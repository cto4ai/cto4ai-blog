Really Sam? Code Red? We have questions.

Starting with: are you familiar with A Few Good Men?

Because in that movie, a Code Red gets a Marine killed. The Colonel who ordered it? Arrested. The Lieutenant who passed it down? Arrested. The Marines who carried it out? Dishonorably discharged.

The famous line - "You can't handle the truth!" - is what the villain screams right before being dragged out in handcuffs.

Did anyone in comms raise their hand?
