Most of this is speculation---but it's well-informed, expert speculation. I expect Vision Pro will have its weaknesses like the original iPhone or Apple Watch, but this is prime Apple territory--introduce a product that's an order of magnitude better than anything that preceded it, albeit with weaknesses, and then refine & advance.
