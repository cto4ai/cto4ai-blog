OpenAI's ChatGPT 5 Thinking - and in fact reasoning models in general - are crazy smart. 

I had massive gaps in my knowledge about Pydantic AI when their v1 announcement dropped yesterday. I asked ChatGPT 5 Thinking to get me up to speed. The result was remarkable - not just surface-level explanations, but deep, contextualized understanding that connected the dots between what I already knew and what I needed to learn.

What struck me most was how the model structured the learning journey. It didn't just dump information; it built scaffolding that made complex concepts stick. This is exactly the kind of AI use case that actually matters for knowledge work.

We're still early in understanding how reasoning models like GPT-5 Thinking change the game for professionals who need to rapidly acquire domain expertise. The speed and quality of knowledge transfer here was genuinely impressive.
