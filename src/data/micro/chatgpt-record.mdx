I set a record yesterday in terms of the most hours co-developing with ChatGPT (GPT-4 default model mostly). I made a decision recently to a) start writing daily, and b) follow [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE)--Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere--to keep control of my content. To enable a) and b), I expanded my blog, Crafty's Illustrated, to support four new microblogging content types (like this one!).  My ChatGPT intern helped with: Hugo templating, Tailwind CSS, shell scripts, how to resolve a Git merge issue, and more.
