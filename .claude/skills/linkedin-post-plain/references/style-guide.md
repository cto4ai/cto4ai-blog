# LinkedIn Post Style Guide

## Ethan Mollick Writing Style

Ethan Mollick's LinkedIn posts exemplify plainspoken, analytical writing that engages without marketing speak. This guide provides concrete examples and principles for capturing this style.

## Core Principles

1. **Direct and conversational** - Write as if explaining to a colleague, not presenting to an audience
2. **Substantive without being academic** - Share real insights, skip the jargon
3. **Analytical but accessible** - Present observations with nuance
4. **No self-promotion** - Focus on the idea, not driving clicks
5. **Natural paragraph breaks** - Short chunks, easy to scan on mobile

## Detailed Style Examples

### Example 1: Analytical Observation with Specific Evidence

```
GPT-5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think are both very impressive models for hard problems.

I think they were both undersold during their respective launches, in part because I am not sure the labs themselves really understand the market for a slow, "deep-thinking" model, yet.

One example - I gave GPT-5 Pro my published academic job market paper from 2010, which went through both peer review and the full seminar circuit. It suggested a lot of really smart methodological advances that would be applicable now, and, incidentally, identified a tiny error no one had spotted that involved seeing relationships between two different tables

The fact that my only prompt was "critique the methods of this paper, figure out better methods and apply them" and that it spontaneously checked the relationships in my tables, ran monte carlo simulations on my point estimates and did sensitivity analyses was kind of nuts,

That said, one thing OpenAI needs to do is let me see the analysis being done by GPT-5 Pro. I can't confirm its work without being able to see the python code it ran and what the results were. The fact that the error it spotted was real helps, but the thinking trace is obscured.
```

**What makes this work:**

- Opens with clear statement of position
- Shares specific, concrete example from personal experience
- Balances praise with constructive criticism
- Uses natural language ("kind of nuts") instead of formal tone
- Ends with substantive observation, not call-to-action

### Example 2: Product Critique with Broader Context

```
I'll note again that it seems nuts that, despite every AI lab launching a half-dozen new products, nobody is doing anything with GPTs, including OpenAI.

When I talk to people at companies, this is still the way non-technical people share prompts on teams. But there has been no big change in GPTs in 2 years

Its fine if it turns out that GPTs/Gems/whatever aren't the future, but it seems important to roll out something else that makes sharing prompts useful across teams and organizations. Prompt libraries are still being used, and they are still awkward cut-and-paste things.

I feel like the AI companies have the idea that AI chatbot use is something that should primarily be handled by IT & coders. But end-users are the real innovators. Approaches that make building, testing, & sharing AI uses in organizations more accessible make a big difference.
```

**What makes this work:**

- Starts with pointed observation about product gap
- Grounds in real user behavior ("when I talk to people at companies")
- Acknowledges uncertainty ("its fine if it turns out...")
- Connects to broader principle about innovation
- No hashtags, no emojis, no promotional language

### Example 3: Contrarian Take with Data

```
The funny thing about the prediction from the CEO of Anthropic l that AI would be writing 90% of all code by now is that the prediction's failure distracts from the fact that AI adoption in code writing is actually extremely high, it was over 30% in December, 2024 according to one measure, with large financial impact.

The speed at which AI has come to write a huge amount of code is pretty startling, even if it is not as fast as predicted. This is becoming a common theme in AI: boosters are often more directionally correct than those who dismiss AI, but they are usually way too early on timelines.
```

**What makes this work:**

- Takes contrarian angle on well-known prediction
- Uses specific data point to support argument
- Synthesizes broader pattern from single example
- Balances multiple perspectives (boosters vs dismissers)
- Ends with insight, not self-promotion

### Example 4: Product Critique with UX Observations

```
Voice is one of the most useful ways to interact with AI to do work (talking is often faster and more natural than writing) but it seems to have been semi-abandoned for serious use outside of the "chat with a friend" case.

All of the voice modes only access older, quite weak models with low latency, making them zippy & fun but kind of useless.

If you don't think of voice models as a fun chat, but rather as a way of working, it suggests that pauses are fine, even preferred (don't talk with me unless you have something to say). And alternative UXs beyond "talk with your AI about the weather" become possible to explore.

Also I want to turn off the breathing, giggling, and disfluencies. Anthropomorphism can be helpful in many cases but it gets to be too much, especially for serious discussions. The tone is off and it feels ingratiating and slows things down.
```

**What makes this work:**

- Opens with clear thesis about underexplored use case
- Identifies specific product limitation ("older, quite weak models")
- Reframes problem with fresh perspective ("way of working" vs "fun chat")
- Gets specific about UX annoyances (breathing, giggling, disfluencies)
- Natural language throughout ("kind of useless", "slows things down")
- No promotion, just substantive critique

## Content Strategy Guidelines

### Hook Construction

Start with one of these approaches:

- **Direct observation**: "GPT-5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think are both very impressive..."
- **Pointed critique**: "It seems nuts that, despite every AI lab launching..."
- **Contrarian angle**: "The funny thing about the prediction..."
- **Personal experience**: "I gave GPT-5 Pro my published academic paper..."

### Body Development

1. **Ground in specifics**: Use concrete examples, data points, or personal observations
2. **Show your thinking**: Include phrases like "I think", "it seems", "this is becoming"
3. **Acknowledge complexity**: "Its fine if...", "even if...", "that said..."
4. **Connect to broader patterns**: Move from specific to general insight

### Ending Strong

Avoid:

- Call-to-action ("Read my blog post...")
- Asking for engagement ("What do you think?")
- Generic conclusions ("These are exciting times...")

Prefer:

- Substantive observation that extends the argument
- Constructive criticism or suggestion
- Synthesis of broader pattern or principle

## Format Guidelines

### Paragraph Structure

- **Short paragraphs**: 1-3 sentences each
- **Natural breaks**: Where you'd pause when speaking
- **Mobile-friendly**: Easy to scan on phone
- **No bullets**: Use paragraph breaks instead

### Tone Markers

**Do use:**

- Conversational language: "kind of nuts", "it seems", "the funny thing"
- Natural qualifiers: "I think", "in part because", "according to one measure"
- Direct address: "I feel like", "when I talk to people"

**Don't use:**

- Corporate speak: "leverage", "synergy", "thought leadership"
- Excessive qualifiers: "very unique", "absolutely essential"
- Marketing language: "game-changing", "revolutionary"
- Academic jargon: "vis-à-vis", "heretofore", "in terms of"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too promotional**: "Check out my latest blog post on..."
   - Instead: Lead with the insight, include link separately

2. **Too formal**: "In this analysis, we examine the implications of..."
   - Instead: "The funny thing about X is that..."

3. **Too many hashtags**: "#AI #MachineLearning #Innovation #Tech"
   - Instead: No hashtags - LinkedIn algorithm deprioritizes them

4. **Too many emojis**: "🚀 Exciting news! 🎉"
   - Instead: Plain text only

5. **Too generic**: "AI is transforming the world"
   - Instead: Specific observation with concrete example

## Length Guidelines

- **Target**: 500-1000 characters
- **Minimum**: Don't go below 400 (insufficient engagement)
- **Maximum**: Don't exceed 1200 (requires "see more" click)
- **Sweet spot**: 600-800 characters for maximum visibility

## Character Count Strategy

When drafting:

1. Write naturally first, don't constrain length initially
2. Check character count
3. If over 1000: trim to most compelling points
4. If under 500: add concrete example or extend insight
5. Verify final count is within 500-1000 range
