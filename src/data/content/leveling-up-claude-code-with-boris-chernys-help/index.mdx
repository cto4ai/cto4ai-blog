I think about the kit of electronic tools that support my work as "The Workflow" and man, did I have a lot of ideas for new tools, improvements, and fixes. This 2XL-sized backlog lived in my head until June '25, when I started a "Workflow Tool ToDos" list in Obsidian. I made progress here and there, with my Obsidian implementation as one example. But progress was more sloth than cheetah.

Claude Opus 4.5 arrived in November, powering up Claude across all its surfaces---Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, and Claude Code. So smart, such encyclopedic knowledge. I used Opus, of course, when I ran into setup issues on tools like my Cursor IDE and Obsidian. But then it occurred to me: what if I made The Worflow itself a project, with a number of specific subprojects, and got very intentional about applying AI to level up? This turned into a rich vein of gold that I've been mining ever since, and actually led to my largest AI coding side projects to date, including [Skillport](skillport). AI granted me the power to radically and continuously improve The Workflow, something I never would have been able to tackle on my own---without my AI pair, there's just too much hard-to-find knowledge needed, too much work involved for each improvement.

But let me focus here on Claude Code.

## Sucking Wind on Claude Code ... Where to Start?

One of my deepest Workflow desires was to tune up my Claude Code setup, to use it the way that I knew it could be used. The problem was, pretty much every aspect of my setup was subpar. Where the heck do I start?

Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, came to my rescue. He posted a great 15-tweet thread about how he personally uses Claude Code. Unlike the rest of us, though, Cherny is using Claude Code to actually write Claude Code. You can see the thread [here on Twitter](x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177), or [here on Threadreader](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/2007179832300581177.html).

## What I've Actually Changed So Far

I figured, what the hell, dive in.

### Ditching VSCode / Cursor

Back when I used VSCode itself, the experience was janky and configuration a nightmare. I've been using Cursor since it arrived, and as a VSCode fork, it inherits the same drawbacks. Furthermore, thanks to Claude Code, I've rarely be tapping into Cursor's AI, probably not at all over the last month. In fact, the AI stuff in Cursor just gets in the way. So I've been paying $20 for the privilege of using VSCode with added AI annoyances (though I hear those have arrived in VSCode, too, in new releases).

I didn't ditch IDEs altogether; I just went light-and-clean with Zed. Such a breath of fresh air. So much is built-in and fast. I've installed a total of three extensions and have comparable functionality to the hairball of 20+ extensions I had running in Cursor.

### Supercharging the CLI: CLI-Mesh

I split my time between two Macs, a deskbound M4 Mac Mini, and a mobile M1 Max MacBook Pro. I had a good terminal app installed (Ghostty) but, because I wasn't fully CLI mode, I hadn't set things up for easy SSH between machines.

Cherny's setup appears to be Ghostty with splits; but in conversations among those who had optimised their CLI configs I heard a lot of talk about `tmux` and spent some time getting my head around terminal multiplexing, persistent resumable sessions, and the like. I decided I wanted what I term "CLI-Mesh" between the two Macs, where I could access persistent CLI sessions on the Mini from the Macbook and vice versa.

I got `tmux` set up with Ghostty but (quite possibly my own fault) I ran into a boatload of problems and the stack of tmux+ghostty+ssh felt fragile. I could have tried something like iTerm2 with `tmux` but ended up on Wezterm, which integrates multiplexing capabilities. So far it's working well, and "anything from anywhere" thanks to CLI-Mesh is pretty sweet.

### Skills and Plugins in Claude Code

I was in the process of an extreme deep-dive into Skills and Plugins when Cherny's post landed: my Christmas break project, [Skillport](skillport). To build Skillport, I needed to research how each Claude surface supported Skills, and understand the Plugin abstraction that wraps Skills and supports Plugin Marketplaces for Claude Code.

Cherny's post lit a fire under me to But I hadn't really used a lot of Skills or other Plugins
