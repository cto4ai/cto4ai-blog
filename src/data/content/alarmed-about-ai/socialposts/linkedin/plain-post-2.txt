Back in February 2023, when ChatGPT was breaking everyone's brains and Bing AI was having multiple personality episodes, I wrote about the recurring pattern of alarm over AI.

The post traced how Ray Kurzweil, Vernor Vinge, and Bill Joy all predicted doom from emerging technologies. But John Seely Brown, former director of Xerox PARC, had the best take: humans adapt once we understand the risks.

Brown - who I was fortunate enough to see speak during this era - saw alarmists as critical input to our adaptation loop, but thought doom predictions ignore how social and technological systems evolve together.

Looking back at 2023's AI alarm two and a half years later, JSB's message feels evergreen. We're still seeing the same cycle: new AI capabilities emerge, people sound alarms, then we adapt and integrate them into society.

The pattern JSB identified in 2000 about technological adaptation continues to play out with every AI breakthrough. We're not doomed - we're adapting. But alarmists, please keep setting off those alarms ...
