I thought AI Vision had won out over "old style OCR" when I wrote [this piece](chatgpt-4v) back in February 2024. I was wrong, I learned recently, when I got more deeply into a real vision project. But I actually think the curves are about to cross.

## Wrong Assumptions

I have a huge knowledge gap, and that is what bit me. I had some significant, but very dated, experience (all bad) with traditional OCR. I then completely skipped the Computer Vision era, and my next significant experience came on the abovementioned learning project where I applied OpenAI's GPT-4V dedicated vision model to extract and structure often-handwritten data. That effort was amazingly successful.

I had heard the term Computer Vision, but assumed that it was on par with what I had already experienced using OCR tools. So in early 2024, I had decided that OCR was dead, long live AI Vision. Wrong.

## Sorry, Guy on Hacker News

I kicked off a new AI Vision project earlier this year. The proof of concept phase mostly went well; I had some extraction problems, especially around checkbox detection on forms that were printed on plastic bags and handwritten, but prompted around these and came into the real implementation confident.

Right around this point, I saw a post https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45354408 on Hacker News (the Qwen3-VL announcement) where the writer was saying he had really bad luck using OpenAI vision models on a particular construction form. (He went on to say that Qwen3-VL did a great job on it.)

I replied with a kind of classic, "you're holding it wrong" response. Sorry, `richardlblair` ... you were right, I was wrong.

## My Comeuppance

So we shifted into real implementation on the vision project, and there was a pre-printed form, which customers would print out, then hand-write onto. Its primary data section, though, was a matrix of checkboxes. Roughly 10 rows by 15 columns.

And just as AIs had there period of not being able to do simple math, I learned that some visual elements were beyond current state of the art, general-purpose but vision-enabled AI models' ability to understand.
