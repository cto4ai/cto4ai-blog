## Introduction

This [post from Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/) appeared on my radar yesterday morning and it hit a chord with me. AI coding tools are a research sweet spot for me--that is, I try very hard to stay up--and I've been working the new cloud-based tools from OpenAI and Anthropic into my workflows as much as possible.

## What to Call These Things?

Willison uses the term "asynchronous coding agents" and introduces that name by first introducing "coding agents" such as Claude Code and Codex CLI, and then explaining why their cloud siblings---Codex Cloud Anthropic’s Claude Code for web---open up a very different mode of operation. He uses the term "fire-and-forget," apparently also used by Martin Fowler, and I think that's spot on. But though "asychronous" is central to why these tools are different, I felt "asynchronous coding agents" didn't optimally capture the concept.

My smart friend Opus 4.1 has a solid understanding of the concept and how people are talking about it, and suggested that "autonomous coding agents" might be slightly better. I concur.

## Why Autonomous Coding Agents are a Level-up

Anthropic has bet heavily on the AI coding space. Its langauge models jumped into the lead with the release of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (June 2024), and Anthropic took another leap ahead with Claude Code (research preview February 2025, GA May 2025), with a minimalist command-line interface that stole me (mostly) away from old friend Cursor. I respected OpenAI and ChatGPT for their strength with consumers and the robustness of their APIs and inference services, but coding belonged to Anthropic.

Over the past two months, though, OpenAI's Codex has shown up on the radar, and what really grabbed me was hearing various OpenAI folks from CEO Greg Brockman to 's xxx, head of xxx, on the xxx podcast, talk about how OpenAI's internal team were using Codex in autonomous agent mode; fire-and-forget. She (was it brockman??) talked about going into meetings and people wanting a couple of minutes before the meeting started to fire off several Codex Cloud cruise missles that would work away during the meeting and be waiting with them when it finished with a pull request. Hearing stories like this repeatedly, my attitude about Codex went from "nah" to "crap, I need to work this in, alongside Claude Code ...." (As you'll see in a minute, the "alongside" part ended up being literally accurate.) t OpenAI DevDay, we sit down with Sherwin Wu and Christina Cai from the OpenAI Platform Team https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBGzWS1qd0

As I was suffering with "gotta get Codex set up" anxiety, Anthropic went and launched "Claude Code on the web" (it's hilarious how bad both OpenAI and Anthropic are with product names). Since I was double deep with Claude Code, getting its web counterpart set up was low effort, and CCOTW ended up being my first Autonomous Coding Agent experience. https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/claude-code-for-web/

But I didn't really get to my point yet: why are ACAs a big deal?

## Fire-and-forget That Works

In Claude Code the coding agent, you can already fire-and-forget. It's called YOLO mode. You turn off all protections, and let Claude do whatever it choose to, which in a command line or terminal interface, is pretty much anything. Nuke the system drive? Sure thing. Wipe the GitHub repo or more it public? Yep. Shut down your AWS cloud? Uh huh. Claude is a good AI-person, better than most, but YOLO mode is dangerous and developers understand the need to use it carefully. So we mostly do our important work in non-YOLO mode, which is a lot of carefully watching what the agent is doing in real time, with regular requests from the agent "can I take this potentially destructive action please?". I get a lot of code written when I pair with Claude Code, but while doing so I'm close to 100% occupied keeping close tabs on what Claude is up to.

What OpenAI and Anthropic really did with ACAs is give us (fairly) safe YOLO mode by equiping their agents with reasonably secure environments that the agent can go to town in, without risking much. "Go to town" means "run whatever you want, safely" -- usually called sandboxing -- but also "code whatever you want, safely -- you can't break anything." This works because the agent does its work in its own personal code space (technically a Git branch). Nothing there impacts our real code, until we've had a chance to carefully look at it and let it in (to be merged).

## Well-defined Specs, Well-equipped Environments

Willison's piece is pulling me the rest of the way into Autonomous Coding Agents; I did the research and set up my first custom Codex Cloud environment just now. Until now, I've been living with Codex's default setup with no customization and conservative default protections.
