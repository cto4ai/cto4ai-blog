As I wrote recently in a post titled [ChatGPT 5 Thinking Is So Damn Smart](/p/chatgpt-5-thinking):

> I spent some time at the [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/) booth at the [AI Engineer World's Fair](https://www.ai.engineer/) in SF this June. Today, I got their announcement that [Pydantic AI v1](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) is out, and decided to write about it.

The point of that post was how superbly 5 Thinking filled in my knowledge gaps around Pydantic AI. As I sat down to write *this* post, using ChatGPT's briefing document as background, I realized that, with a bit of refinement, that document wasn't just suitable as background for this post---it should actually **BE** the core of this post. It was a joint effort---I conceived the need, I asked the questions, I played the role of critic and editor through dozens of iterations---GPT5 Thinking did the research, drafting and rewriting.

I write as a learning exercise, but spending hours or days to improve upon the CTO's Field Guide to Pydantic AI below would have impeded rather than furthered my learning. I resonate with Ethan Mollick's experience working with [Claude's new Excel-spreadsheet-editing features](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_claudes-surprise-new-ability-to-work-with-activity-7371375383125889024-3C9Y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAABcNZsBSiPCgo2Gr9o5anU48UXl131Q-_M):

> Claude's surprise new ability to work with Excel files is the best I have seen so far.
>
> I have given it existing spreadsheets to work with and asked it to create new ones. Good use of formatting, formulas, etc.
> 
> It created all of this, including 406 formulas, from one prompt (& its very solid, would be a good result of a week-long team project for my MBA class).

 Instead of embarking on my own week-long project to do a better Field Guide, I'll post this one, having learned plenty in the role of editor, and move on to the next learning exercise in my very long queue.
