Sam Altman declared a "Code Red" at OpenAI this week.

My first question: Did anyone in comms raise their hand?

"Sir, I love the energy, but in the movie this ends with Jack Nicholson being dragged out of a courtroom in handcuffs."

"Sir, the Code Red literally kills someone."

In A Few Good Men, a Code Red is an illegal hazing order. The Colonel who gives it believes he's the hero. He's convinced he alone understands what's at stake. He gives a legendary speech about how the people criticizing him should be thanking him.

He gets arrested in the final scene. He does not see it coming.

Three years ago, almost to the day, ChatGPT launched and Google declared their own Code Red. Pichai upended teams. Googlers spent their holidays scrambling.

Now it's OpenAI's turn to cancel Christmas. The company that started the industry-wide panic is now panicking.

The movie's on. The cast has been assembled. The only question is whether anyone at OpenAI has watched it all the way to the end.
