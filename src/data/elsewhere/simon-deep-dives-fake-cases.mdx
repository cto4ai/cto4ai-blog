[Lawyer cites fake cases invented by ChatGPT, judge is not amused](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/27/lawyer-chatgpt/) Simon Willison does a deep review of the ChatGPT aspects of the recent case where a lawyer submitted ChatGPT-hallucinated case law. The story starts out as a standard ChatGPT hallucination, but got crazier when ChatGPT doubled down when asked to confirm if the cases were real. (I actually ran the confirmation prompt Willison used and it [worked for me](https://chat.openai.com/share/e0a2a287-108d-4c49-9c95-d955fc5d5345))
