## Frogs and Scientists

There's a very old joke about scientists and frogs ...

<aside class="bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 dark:from-gray-800 dark:to-gray-900 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg shadow-md">
  <div class="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
    <p class="text-lg italic mb-4">
      A scientist was interested in studying how far bullfrogs can jump. He brought a bullfrog into his laboratory, set
      it down, and commanded, "Jump, frog, jump!"
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">The frog jumped.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      The scientist measured the distance, then noted in his journal, <em>"Frog with four legs jumped six feet."</em>
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">Then he cut the frog's front legs off and ordered, "Jump, frog, jump!"</p>

    <p class="mb-4">The frog struggled and jumped.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      The scientist noted in his journal, <em>"Frog with two legs jumped two feet."</em>
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">Next, the scientist cut off the frog's back legs. Once more, he shouted, "Jump, frog, jump!"</p>

    <p class="mb-4">The frog just lay there.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">"Jump, frog, jump!" the scientist repeated.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Nothing.</p>

    <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">
      The scientist noted in his journal, <em>"Frog with no legs is deaf."</em>
    </p>

## Vision Model

I've been on a deep-dive working with vision models over the past few weeks; specifically [Qwen3 VL](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-VL), which just launched the last week of October. We're running inference on the model via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) providers. [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code/) has been my go-to AI Coding tool for this project.

Two consequences of working with an extremely new model like Qwen3 VL:

- The coding model ([Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5) for me) will have literally no training data to help ground its reasoning
- There will be lots of complex problems to work through

## "Frog with no legs is deaf"

The old frog joke came to mind multiple times over the weekend, when I had asked Claude to assist in diagnosing a problem. It would step through a valid chain of reasoning, and then at the very end, out would pop a ridiculous conclusion, like the joke's "frog with no legs is deaf."

The takeaway: When your model skating on thin ice---little or no context to ground its reasoning---be suspicious of its conclusions.
