In his recent AI Engineer talk, Google DeepMind's Kevin Hou says they're betting that the next step function in AI coding tools looks like Antigravity—a platform that's the opposite of Anthropic's thin-wrapper approach with Claude Code.

Where Anthropic says "we don't know what the experience should be, so we've made Claude Code a thin wrapper around our great coding models," DeepMind is saying "we know what the next step function should look like, here's Antigravity."

The result is "Unapologetically Agent-First"—a platform with three surfaces: a code editor, an agent-controlled Chrome browser, and an Agent Manager that pulls you a level above just looking at code. It lets you manage many agents at once and uses Artifacts that serve as long-running memory and communication tools. Agent Manager isn't just an agent, it's an orchestrator.

The part that took me five rewatches to understand: Nano Banana Pro isn't just for generating fun images: it's powerful enough to generate full application UIs. With Agent Manager orchestrating, a 14-word prompt like "generate a new UI look and feel for this app" is transformed into a full mockup that you can annotate and iterate on. And then Antigravity can implement that design in code.

Design-to-code, all orchestrated. That's a genuinely new workflow.
