I spent some time at the Pydantic booth at the AI Engineer World's Fair in SF this June. Today, I got their announcement that Pydantic AI v1 is out, and decided to write about it.

I had Grand Canyon sized gaps in my knowledge about Pydantic AI, though, and decided to ask ChatGPT 5 Thinking to help me get up to speed. 

**NAILED IT.** Here's the chat transcript. 

<ChatTranscript

  maxHeight="600px"
  transcript={pydanticAiConversation}
  toolName="ChatGPT 5 Thinking"
/>

Two notes:

1. The idea of having a component to render chat transcripts inside blog posts was stolen from [Orta Therox](https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/07/30/six-weeks-of-claude-code/). I worked with Claude Code to vibe code my version from scratch.
2. ChatGPT 5 Thinking believed it was writing the blog post itself. It was not; I'll be doing that by hand.
