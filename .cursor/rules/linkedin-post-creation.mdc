# LinkedIn Post Creation

Inputs:
- Source: main post at `src/data/content/{slug}/index.mdx` or a selected section of that post.

Output:
- Write the LinkedIn posts to `src/data/content/{slug}/socialposts/linkedin/post.txt`, post2.txt, etc.
- If `post.txt` already exists, create `post-2.txt`, `post-3.txt`, etc. Do not overwrite existing files.

Steps:
1. Read front matter from the source post (`title`, `description`, `date`, optional `tags`). Determine the canonical URL for the post.
2. Draft 6 variants of LinkedIn copy:
   - Short variant: ~500 characters
   - Longer variant: ~1,000 characters
   - Very long: more than 2,500 but under the 3,000 character limit
   - For each of these, do a version with just a single link to the original post, and another that adds 3 additional helpful links (items linked in the main post but not more than one of the three should be links to my own blog) with the link to the original post at the end.
3. Structure each variant:
   - Hook line (1 strong sentence)
   - 1–3 succinct insights or takeaways (sentences or short bullets)
   - Call to action with the post URL (plain URL, not markdown)
   - 2-5 specific hashtags at the end - not more than 5
4. Style guidelines:
   - Professional, clear, and skimmable
   - Use plain URLs (no markdown links)
   - Break paragraphs with blank lines for readability
5. Images:
   - Select 1–3 relevant images from the post directory if available
   - Do not place images inline within the text
   - At the end of the file, add an “Images to attach” section listing filenames to upload in LinkedIn
6. Hashtags:
   - Prefer specific topics over generic ones (e.g., `#GenerativeAI` over `#AI`)
   - Include project-relevant tags when appropriate (e.g.,   `#Astro`, `#TailwindCSS`, `#EngineeringLeadership`)
7. Saving:
   - Ensure the destination directory exists: `socialposts/linkedin/`
   - Save using Unix line endings (LF)
8. Emojis
   - Use emojis on the title line and each major point
   - Use index-finger-pointing-right for the line with link URL

🐳 **Containing Agent Chaos: The Docker Creator's Next Act**

One of my favorite talks at #AIEWF2025 was Solomon Hykes, talking about his new creation Dagger in the session "Containing Agent Chaos." No AI hype here—Hykes has creds—he created Docker.

💥 **The Problem**: "An agent is an LLM **wrecking its environment** in a loop"

Running 1 agent? No problem. But try scaling to 10 agents - today's options are either "YOLO mode" or expensive cloud isolation.

🔧 **The Solution**: "Container use for agents" - not sandboxing, but complete isolated development environments where agents do their work entirely inside containers.

⚡ **The Tech Stack**: Containers + Git + Models = everything we need already exists, just needs native integration.

🎯 **The Live Demo**: Hykes spawned 6 Claude Code instances + 1 Goose instance, all iterating on a website project in complete isolation. Orchestrating developer can merge any instance's output they like.

🚀 **The Grand Finale**: Open-sourced a core element of Dagger—"container-use"—live on stage while agents were still spinning away!

The future of agent orchestration isn't about fancy UIs - it's about leveraging existing container/Git tech that humans barely use but agents can exploit perfectly.
