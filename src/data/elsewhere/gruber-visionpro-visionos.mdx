[John Gruber's First Impressions of Vision Pro and visionOS](https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/first_impressions_of_vision_pro_and_visionos) Gruber conveys the essence of the experience better than other writeups I've read so far. Unlike a traditional media outlet with their usual needs to drive readership, avoid pissing off Apple, appear balanced, etc., Gruber pretty much straight says what he thinks, which is useful.
