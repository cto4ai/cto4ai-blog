title: "Vivek Haldar on GitHub Copilot"
description: "Speaking only for myself, I get orders of magnitude more value from [GitHub Copilot] than the $10/month it costs. How? Copilot (often used in conjunction with GPT, and now, Bard) has reduced the activation energy for the small scripty projects I want to undertake from being just slightly over a weekend (which meant they would get abandoned or not even started) to fitting comfortably within a weekend. And that has made a world of difference, at least for me. I suspect the same story will play out across programmers in general, where it will serve to lower the friction and frustration of programming just enough to increase their overall output."
