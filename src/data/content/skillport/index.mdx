## Anthropic's Fantastic Fall of Skills-n-Tools

I joke about AI years being like dog years, but I just asked Claude to give me Anthropic's 2025 timeline of important announcements and releases, and for this post I decided to drop everything before August 25th, because the stuff that happened earlier **seems like ancient history**.

Over a period of just 15 weeks\*, here's what Anthropic announced and delivered:

| Date   | Announcement                                                        | Why Important for Skills & Tools                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Aug 25 | Code Execution update — Bash + file ops (`code_execution_20250825`) | **Foundation for Skills runtime.** Skills need to execute code, not just generate it. Bash support means Skills can run shell scripts, install packages, and manipulate files — the primitives that make document-creation Skills possible.                                                                   |
| Sep 9  | Create and edit files — Skills-powered file creation (preview)      | **Skills' first killer app.** This feature is entirely powered by Skills internally (docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf). Proves the Skills architecture works for end-users, not just developers.                                                                                                                         |
| Sep 29 | Claude Agent SDK                                                    | **Skills infrastructure goes public.** The Agent SDK is the same runtime that powers Claude Code. Now any developer can build agents with the same primitives Anthropic uses internally.                                                                                                                      |
| Oct 16 | **Skills launch** — Public Skills + /v1/skills API                  | **The main event.** Skills become a first-class API primitive. Developers can create, version, and deploy Skills. Enterprise customers can manage Skills organization-wide.                                                                                                                                   |
| Oct 21 | Create and edit files GA — Network/egress controls                  | **Enterprise-ready Skills execution.** Admins can control what Skills can access (package managers only, allowlisted domains, or full internet). Critical for regulated industries.                                                                                                                           |
| Oct 27 | Claude for Excel — Excel add-in (research preview)                  | **Skills meet enterprise workflows.** Excel is where finance actually happens. An Excel Skill that understands workbooks, formulas, and cell references is a template for domain-specific Skills.                                                                                                             |
| Nov 4  | **Code execution with MCP** — Engineering blog                      | **The conceptual foundation.** Explains why presenting MCP tools as code APIs (instead of direct tool calls) dramatically reduces token overhead. Explicitly connects to Skills — agents can persist reusable code with SKILL.md files. This paper laid the groundwork for Advanced Tool Use two weeks later. |
| Nov 20 | **Advanced Tool Use** — Tool Search Tool, Programmatic Tool Calling | **Patterns that apply to Skills and MCP.** Skills frequently pair with MCP servers, and these patterns — deferred loading, on-demand discovery, programmatic orchestration — apply directly to that layer. We've already adapted these concepts within Skillport.                                             |
| Nov 24 | Opus 4.5 — 80.9% SWE-bench, $5/$25 pricing                          | **Better model + lower prices = more Skill usage.** 67% price cut on Opus makes complex, multi-Skill workflows economically viable.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Nov 24 | Claude for Excel — Beta expands to all Max, Team, Enterprise        | **Excel Skill matures.** Adds pivot tables, charts, file uploads. Validates the "Skill as Office add-in" pattern at broader scale.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Nov 25 | MCP Nov spec — Async ops, registry, extensions                      | **MCP becomes Skill-compatible.** Async operations mean long-running Skills don't block. Extensions framework hints at Skill-like modularity in the protocol itself. Registry shows how discovery could work.                                                                                                 |
| Dec 3  | Bun acquisition                                                     | **Anthropic is serious about tooling.** Acquiring a JavaScript runtime signals investment in the execution layer that Skills depend on.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Dec 9  | MCP → Linux Foundation — AAIF with OpenAI, Block, Google, Microsoft | **Skills' transport layer is now neutral.** MCP under Linux Foundation means Skills can flow across any platform that adopts MCP. Anthropic can't be accused of lock-in. Competitors have to adopt or fragment.                                                                                               |
| Dec 18 | **Agent Skills open standard** — Portable Skills, enterprise admin  | **Skills become portable.** Skills built for Claude work in ChatGPT, Cursor, or any adopting platform. This is the "write once, run anywhere" moment for agent capabilities. Partner directory (Atlassian, Notion, Figma) shows ecosystem momentum.                                                           |

Especially considering the compressed timeline---4 elapsed months with three major U.S. holidays ha

has been on a roll, all through 2025 but seemingly in overdrive in November and December.

I'd been working with several clients to automate business workflows using Claude, lots of MCPs, and lots of shared prompts. The downsizes of managing (deployment??) and using (context overhead!!) many MCPs soon became clear, as did the pain of managing the prompts and other assets that encapsulated the domain knowledge behind those workflows.

Then: Skills! As you can see here, here, here and here, I'm quite enamored of them. Skills happen to be the perfect abstraction for capturing the domain knowledge behind any business workflow. There are lots of other amazing ways to use Skills, but **all** of my clients have this particular need, so it's prominent on my radar. And Skills worked on all Claude surfaces: Claud.ai on the web, Claude Desktop on Mac and Windows, and Claude Code.

## Skill Distribution and Plugin (Skill) Marketplaces

Anthropic was on a roll with Skills through November and December. A really exciting development was Plugin Marketplaces for Claude Code. Plugins are a container that encompasses Skills, as well as /Commands, Hooks, and Agents. And Plugin Marketplaces are a way for Claude Code users to gain access to shared public (Git-based) repositories of those items, Skills first and foremost among them, in my humble opinion at least.

Plugin Marketplaces are just for Claude Code users, though, and currently only support public repos. In my workflow use cases, I need mainly the other Claude surfaces---Claude Desktop and Claude.ai---though I'm a big supporter of Skills in Claude Code also. And public repos are a non-starter, as we can't expose critical business workflows publicly.

## MCP Troubles

And then there are the MCP downsides, which are sizable even for relatively small organizations. Although it's gotten better with Anthropic's 4.5 series of models, first Sonnet and more recently Opus 4.5, MCPs as traditionally written (tons of tools) are model context killers. Also painful was that support for remote MCPs and OAuth authentication lagged the initial wave of local MCPs, and local MCPs only worked with Claude Code and Claude Desktop, not Claude the web.

But Anthropic has been very busy; they introduced "Connectors," which are properly-packaged remote MCPs with (eventually) first class support for OAuth, and these work across all Claude surfaces including Claude.ai on the web. (Claude on Mobile has some limited support also).

Then, in their November-December blitz, Anthropic[^1] began promoting and supporting new approaches that enable far more context-efficient and performant ways for models to use MCPs (Programmable Tool Calling, Advanced Tool Use).
In a nutshell, instead of the model engaging directly with (MCP) tools and doing lots of back and forth, generating high context consumption, the model can instead write code that does the tool calling and then assembles what the model needs without the model bearing the context weight of all the intermediate results. Skills can play a key role in orchestrating all of this.

Enabling this mode of operation is what Anthropic calls the Code Execution Tool, which they've gradually been provisioning to all Claude surfaces, granting with the ability to execute code in sandboxed cloud environments. Claude Code got Claude Code on the web; Claude.ai and Desktop got Claude for Excel and Agent Skills that leverage script execution. Code Execution Tool across all Claude surfaces means we are tantalizingly close to Skill-based Programmable Tool Calling, Advanced Tool Use on all Claude surfaces.

## Ending 2025: Momentum and Gaps

Ending 2025, it is fair to say that Skills backed by (MCP) tools had tremendous momentum, strong support and tooling from Anthropic, other big players jumping on the bandwagon, and rapidly accelerating uptake. The Skill ecosystem was a perfect fit for my workflow automation needs, but I still had some serious itches that needed scratching, happs that needed filling.

- Skill distribution was weak: Claude Code had a solid foundation for a solution with Plugin Marketplaces, but with significant limitation of "public repos only." Claude's non-developer surfaces lacked support for these Marketplaces; distribution of skills involved sharing .skill files over slack or email.
- Skills need tools, with MCPs as the typical provider of tools; but as described above, context overhead, performance, and distribution all inflicted their respective pain.
- Anthropic's November-December releases made the promise of Skills that much more real, with code execution and advanced tool use available in some contexts but but didn't quite are typicllClaude Code aloLocal MCPs even those aren't meeting the enterprise need they didn't meetI was seeking ways to But I had some itches to scr
