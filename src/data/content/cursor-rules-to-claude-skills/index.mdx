## Friday Night

I usually tackle a couple hours of coding on Friday nights, and my current AI vision project was blocked awaiting others' work, so I scanned for something I've been wanting to look into and landed on Skills in Claude Code.

## Wrong Skills

While I'm deeply familiar with Claude Skills, it's in the context of Claude.ai and Claude Desktop, as opposed to Claude Code. Though I use Claude Code on a daily basis, and have built custom slash commands for CD, I hadn't gotten around to trying Rules yet. Now that I know what I was missing, I wish I had started sooner ...

I'm not a typical developer. I spend as many hours each week writing and publishing content---here on [cto4.ai](cto4.ai), using the Astro framework---as I do coding. Then again, I'm not a typical writer either [link to copy wrting guy?] [link to my brief]: rather than living in Google Docs, or God forbid, MS Word, I'm writing in an IDE (Cursor), and my work product is Markdown files. For me, "writing" also includes a significant percentage of light-tech work: most commonly, building and applying Astro's JSX-like components. You can see two of these Astro component examples below: ChatTranscript (for the Claude Code chat) and MDContent (for the Complete Guide).

My most complex workflows are writing- rather than coding-related, so as my learning project for Skills in Claude Code, I decided to tackle migrating a couple of my core Astro Cursor Rules[^1] over to Skills.

[^1]: Not the old .cursorrules version, but rather the newer flavor where rules live under .cursor/rules/[rulename].mdc

## Why Migrate?

My AI projects don't need to make sense; they are, just like my writing, primarily a learning exercise. There's nothing major wrong with Cursor Rules, and no burning reason to migrate away from them. Expanding my knowledge of Anthropics' elegant Rules pattern, especially in the domain of Claude Code? Now **_that_** makes sense. I had a strong suspicion that I was missing something by not using Skills in Claude Code. And there were other reasons as well:

- The most painful aspect of my work with Claude across all platforms is context exhaustion and its consequences: periodic model brain death in Claude Code, and in the case of Claude.ai and Claude Desktop, just plain quitting: "Dude, you gotta start all over again, sorry dude." I know that Skills are optimized to conserve context and reduce the frequency of context exhaustion.
- I find Claude Code (as an agent), to generally be a smarter, better co-worker than Cursor (as an agent), even though I'm typically running on the same underlying models (Claude Sonnet 4.5 currently). I figured, if I cut over my writing automations to Skills in Claude Code, I'd end up with a better writing companion.
- Cursor's sandboxing functionality has been rolled out in such a way that it is breaking my workflows. I'm sure there's a setting somewhere to restore previous behavior but so far I haven't found it.

## Step 1: Migrating Some Cursor Rules to Claude Skills

My first step was to have a long, and at times stern, conversation with Claude Code, wherein we migrated my first writing-automation Cursor Rule to become a Claude Skill. This Skill had to do with all the scaffolding work needed to create a new Astro blog post, using my unique library of components and approach to permalink slugs, directory structures and request routing. Here's the Skill name and brief description in the main SKILL.md file:

```yaml
name: astro-scaffold
description: Technical scaffolding for cto4.ai Astro blog posts. This skill should
be used when creating new blog posts, setting up post directory structures, adding
technical components (images, galleries, chat transcripts, embedded content), or
configuring post frontmatter and imports.
```

CC needed guidance in several key areas:

- Claude Code's naive initial approach was to jump right in and perform a simple one-to-one conversion of the Cursor Rule into a single-file Skill. This would have been the wrong thing to do, and not leveraged the core benefits of Skills. I had to talk Claude down.
- Because I'm familiar with Skills in Claude.ai, I know that Anthropic has a very nice Skill called `skill-creator` that's really great at writing Skills and applying all their requisite principles. I had to fight Claude a bit to convince it to install that Skill, partly because I wasn't yet aware of how Claude Code located and installed Skills, and so didn't know the right words to use.
- CC's first attempt at a Skill violated many of Anthropic's core tenets of Skills, such as brevity, progressive disclosure, etc. I had to force the agent to re-read `skill-creator` carefully, and then self-critique what it had generated. Give it credit: Claude's self-critique was excellent, and its second take on the at tj.

Here's that conversation[^2]:

[^2]: Thank you `claude-conversation-extractor` (`uv tool install claude-conversation-extractor`)

<ChatTranscript theme="adium" maxHeight="600px" transcript={cursorRulesPoc} />

I then tackled a second Rule => Skill migration which resulted in:

```yaml
name: chat-transcript
description: Convert AI chat transcripts from various sources (Claude Code, Cursor,
Claude.ai via claude-conversation-extractor, Claude.ai legacy format, ChatGPT) to
TypeScript and embed them in cto4.ai blog posts using the ChatTranscript component.
Use when adding AI conversation transcripts to blog posts or when user has exported
chat sessions to include in content.
```

## Step 2: Getting Well Informed Enough to Write About It

Everything You Need to Know About Skills in Claude Code

The first think I

One of AI's sweet spots is "help me understand X in the context of Y." In my case, X was Claude Skills and Y was Claude Code.

[What if you don't need MCP at all](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/)

The answer is **Skills** - but they're far more powerful than simple instruction files. Skills in Claude Code are:

- **Portable** across Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, and Claude Code
- **Discoverable** through a plugin marketplace ecosystem
- **Shareable** with your team via git or plugin repositories
- **Progressive** - they load only what's needed to minimize token usage
- **Composable** - they work alongside MCP servers, slash commands, and subagents

To help bridge this gap, I asked Claude.ai to create a comprehensive guide explaining Skills from the perspective of someone already familiar with Claude.ai and Claude Desktop. The result is the complete reference below.

## Testing the Chat Transcript Skill

Here's a test of the new chat-transcript skill, showing the actual conversation where we developed the proof of concept:

The conversation above shows the iterative process of:

OK, I want to do some proof of concept work converting Cursor Rules into Claude Skills.

You are out of date on how Cursor Rules work, please web search to come up to speed. Hint, see .cursor/rules

nope.

This is much more than a simple 1:1 conversion. Let's work through it.

First of all, I am already working with Claude Skills in Claude.ai and Claude Desktop and fully understand them in that context. What I am unfamiliar with is the equivalent setup for Claude Code. Where are they stored? Can Skills be global as well as project-specific, etc.

Also: Anthropic has created a Skill for authoring Skills. It's automatically installed in Claude.ai and Claude Desktop but you will definitely want to use that skill here.

Please follow my instructions. "Let's find and install the Claude skill for creating Skills as a first step"

I literally want that skill installed, first, as a global skill

ok, so using the skill-creator skill, let's create a new skill that enables me to scaffold new posts on the cto4.ai blog which is astro based. The cursor skill for this is .cursor/rules/astro-mdx-content-authoring.mdc

First, some background: I write the blog posts, the AI does not. The only writing the AI does is, for example, creating draft social posts based on hand-written content. The AI does assist with constructng posts as they often have some fiddly technical bits such as the AI chat transcript component. So "scaffolding" is much more accurate than "authoring" in that sense. 1- both creating and authoring; 2a- generally the agent is able to accomplish the task quickly without needing a script; 2b- I am open to structuring files in the Skill apprpriately e.g. to support progressive disclosure. But there's no need for "authoring guide" in the sense of the writing itself, as the AI doesn't do that. 2c - see 2b; the agent does need to set up the templated content but the Cursor rule does this very effectively without a separate template file. It's just front matter and some imports. 3- In cursor I specifically invoke the rule by using @ to add it as context.

I think we'll want to specifically invoke the skill, along the lines of:
Use the astro-scaffold skill to scaffold a new post titled "Migrating from Cursor Rules to Claude Skills"

I don't believe you followed the guidelines in the skill-creator skill. Please review those guidelines and critically review what you created in the astro-scaffold skill, identify what needs to be corrected.

Use the astro-scaffold skill to scaffold a new post titled "Migrating from Cursor Rules to Claude Skills"

When I first started exploring Claude Code, I noticed many developers were familiar with using `.cursorrules` files in Cursor IDE to customize AI behavior. Coming from that background, I wondered: what's the equivalent in Claude Code?

OK, I am testing this in Cursor now to compare.

I am issuing this command to Cursor agent
Use the @astro-mdx-content-authoring.mdc rule to scaffold a new post titled "Evaluating Claude Skills as an alternative to Cursor Rules"

OK, done, here is he result. Please compare -- don't make any changes to our Skill yet, just analyze how we did

## Next Steps

Now that you understand how Skills work in Claude Code, you can start migrating your `.cursorrules` workflows:

1. **Identify repeatable patterns** in your Cursor rules
2. **Create Skills** for each distinct workflow or methodology
3. **Use skill-creator** to help structure them properly
4. **Share with your team** via project-level `.claude/skills/` directory

The beauty of Skills is that they're not just local configuration - they're shareable, discoverable knowledge that can benefit your entire team.

1. I am perpetually in "push the AI boundaries mode" especially in the AI coding space, as I discussed in my post [Autonomous Coding Agents: Fire and Forget]() recently.
2. On average, I spend as many hours each week writing and publishing content (here at cto4.ai, using the Astro framework) as I do coding.
3. My "writing" is 66% typing words, and 33% the light-tech work of building and applying Astro components. This post is a case in point; see the Complete Guide to Skills in Claude Code below, a great resource that resulted from a very long conversation in Claude Desktop to fill in my Skills in Claude Code knowledge gap. This is Claude Markdown Artifact, repurposed to publish here using an Astro component called MDContent.
4. I write in Cursor, using AI to automate the time-consuming bits and things I don't want to memorize. (I don't use AI to write for me; I do use it sometimes to summarize into a smaller format such as social posts, and sometime publish the model's research outputs as with The Complete Guide to Skills in Claude Code below.)

This automation, until yesterday, was done using Cursor Rules.
