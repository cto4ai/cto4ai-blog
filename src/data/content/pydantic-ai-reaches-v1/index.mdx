As I wrote recently in a post titled [ChatGPT 5 Thinking Is So Damn Smart](/p/chatgpt-5-thinking):

> I spent some time at the [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/) booth at the [AI Engineer World's Fair](https://www.ai.engineer/) in SF this June. Today, I got their announcement that [Pydantic AI v1](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) is out, and decided to write about it.

The point of that post was how superbly 5 Thinking did at filling in the significant gaps I had in my understanding of Pydantic AI. As I sat down to write this post, using ChatGPT's briefing document as background, I realized that, with a bit of refinement, that document isn't just suitable as background for this post---it should actually **BE** the meat of this post. I asked the questions, and played the role of critic and editor; GPT5 Thinking did the research and writing. 

I write primarily as a learning exercise, but I couldn't make the CTO's Field Guide to Pydantic AI: Comprehensive Analysis below much better than it already is, even if I poured days of additional work into it. I resonate with Ethan Mollick's experience working with Claude's new spreadsheet-editing features:

> Claude's surprise new ability to work with Excel files is the best I have seen so far.
>
> I have given it existing spreadsheets to work with and asked it to create new ones. Good use of formatting, formulas, etc.
> 
> It created all of this, including 406 formulas, from one prompt (& its very solid, would be a good result of a week-long team project for my MBA class). 

 Instead of embarking on my own week-long project to do a better Field Guide, I'll post this one, having learned plenty in the role of editor, and move on to the next learning exercise in my very long queue.
