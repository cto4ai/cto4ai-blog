To understand why I built Skillport, we need to do some looking at what Anthropic was up to in 2025, focusing on what I'm calling **Skills+Tools+CodeExec**. Why am I coining this crazy shorthand name?

- **Skills** are fantastic, but to be powerful they need ...
- **Tools** (often exposed over the Model Context Protocol, MCP), which give the Skill access to critical business context; and ...
- **Sandboxed code execution**, essential for supporting efficient tool use as well as the full breadth of the Claude product line including web.

Maybe there's an even shorter shorthand:

<div class="text-center text-2xl font-serif italic my-6">Skills++ = Skills + Tools + CodeExec</div>

## Anthropic's Fantastic Year in Skills++

I often joke about AI years being like dog years. I just asked Claude to give me Anthropic's 2025 timeline of important announcements and releases to include in this post:

<SingleImage

  alt="Claude conversation requesting Anthropic 2025 announcements timeline"
  postDir="skillport"
  size="2xl"
/>

It's amazing the degree to which early 2025 announcements **seem like ancient history!** I ended up greatly condensing the initial list, but here's the [original in full detail](#)---bear in mind that I didn't request all announcements, just those germane to Skillport.

Starting in May, here's what Anthropic announced and delivered that directly related to Skills++:

Proves the Skills architecture works for end-users, not just developers.                                                                                                                         |
| Sep 29                                         | Claude Agent SDK                                                    | **Skills infrastructure goes public.** The Agent SDK is the same runtime that powers Claude Code. Now any developer can build agents with the same primitives Anthropic uses internally.                                                                                                                      |

Runs in Anthropic-managed sandboxes with GitHub integration. Parallel task execution means overseeing a "fleet" of coding agents.                                                                          |

Critical for regulated industries.                                                                                                                           |
| Oct 27                                         | Claude for Excel — Excel add-in (research preview)                  | **Skills meet enterprise workflows.** Excel is where finance actually happens. An Excel Skill that understands workbooks, formulas, and cell references is a template for domain-specific Skills.                                                                                                             |

Explicitly connects to Skills — agents can persist reusable code with SKILL.md files. This paper laid the groundwork for Advanced Tool Use two weeks later. |
| Nov 20                                         | **Advanced Tool Use** — Tool Search Tool, Programmatic Tool Calling | **Patterns that apply to Skills and MCP.** Skills frequently pair with MCP servers, and these patterns — deferred loading, on-demand discovery, programmatic orchestration — apply directly to that layer. We've already adapted these concepts within Skillport.                                             |

Bundles now work in any MCP-compatible app, not just Claude. Same week as Advanced Tool Use — the distribution format matures alongside the usage patterns.                                                                    |

## Skills: Domain Expertise Codified

Throughout 2025, I had been working with clients to apply AI in critical business workflows, cobbling together Claude, lots of MCPs, and lots of large, complicated prompts. The results were often fantastic---what used to take days done in a few hours---but the cobbling together part was painful, as were the realities of deploying and running first-generation local MCPs.

Skills arrived on Sept 9th. Furthermore, "those who watch closely," people like Simon Willison, realized that the announcement two weeks earlier of Claude's incredible "create and edit files" feature, which enables direct creation and editing of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and PDF files right in Claude conversations, was actually powered by Skills. At this point, it became clear that we were moving beyond the age of "cobbling together" such solutions. Now we had an elegant abstraction for capturing the domain knowledge behind any business workflow. And Skills worked across all Claude surfaces: Claude.ai on the web, Claude Desktop on Mac and Windows, and Claude Code.

## Skill Distribution for Claude Code: Plugin Marketplaces

On November 3rd, Anthropic announced Plugin Marketplaces for Claude Code. Plugins are Anthropic's name for a category of artifacts that Claude Code users might want to create, reuse, and share, including slash commands, hooks, agents, and---you guessed it---Skills. Plugin Marketplaces are public git repositories on GitHub, Gitlab, etc. that contain these artifacts, and that any Claude Code user can attach to and download from. Installing a Skill or other artifact takes just a command or two in Claude Code. The Plugin Marketplace repo design is another elegant piece of work by Anthropic and, among other things, supports versioning.

Very exciting, but doesn't scratch my particular itch: it's only for Claude Code (read: developers), and only supports public repositories, a non-starter for critical business workflows.

## Packaged, Context-friendly, Performant MCPs

Anthropic has been steadily chipping away at MCP's downsides: distribution, context overhead, and performance.

On the distribution front, June brought one-click-installable Desktop Extensions (local MCPs); July a Connectors directory (Remote MCPs); and November MCP Bundles (MCPB), the successor to Desktop Extensions.

On the context overhead front, November was a big month: Anthropic[^1] began promoting a radically more context-efficient and performant models-to-MCP interaction (Programmatic Tool Calling). In a nutshell, instead of the model directly calling all the tools itself, resulting in high context consumption, the model instead **writes code** that does the tool calling and assembles what the model needs. As a result, the model no longer bears the context weight of all the intermediate results, with the added benefit the code runs much faster. Skills can play a key role in orchestrating all of this.

## Ubiquitous, Sandboxed Code Execution in the Cloud

If you're going to get the benefit of Programmatic Tool Calling across all Claude surfaces, you need a place to run those programs that works across all Claude platforms, including the web. Anthropic has kept chipping away at this also. Code execution first arrived in May as part of the Claude 4 model launches, enabling Claude models on all surfaces including the web to run Python scripts. In August, Claude gained the ability to run Bash scripts and perform file system operations. All of the above were prerequisites for Skills generally and the "create and edit files" Skill specifically, which launched just a few weeks later. October brought us Claude Code on the Web, a long-running-agent-loop mode for Claude Code that was completely reliant on sandboxed code execution in the cloud, as well as networking support with egress controls that are essential for such a sandbox.

## The Christmas Itch That Needed Scratching

All of these great announcements and releases, so much promise ... but heading into the end of year lull, I still didn't quite have what I needed to really do business workflow automations right. What was missing:

- Skill distribution was weak: Claude Code had a solid foundation for a solution with Plugin Marketplaces, but with significant limitation of "public repos only." Claude's non-developer surfaces lacked support for these Marketplaces; distribution of skills involved sharing .skill files over slack or email.
- Skills need tools, with MCPs as the typical provider of tools; but as described above, context overhead, performance, and distribution all inflicted their respective pain.
- Anthropic's November-December releases made the promise of Skills that much more real, with code execution and advanced tool use available in some contexts but but didn't quite are typicllClaude Code aloLocal MCPs even those aren't meeting the enterprise need they didn't meetI was seeking ways to But I had some itches to scr
