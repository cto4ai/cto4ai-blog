I just did an upgrade of my Astro-based blog to the latest-Astro-that-makes-sense-right-now which turns out to be 5.16.5. Having just finished a deep dive into Antigravity and ingested some Koolaid about agent managers and agent-ready integrated browsers, I decided to see if I could automate QA testing of my blog, and run do a thorough rather than minimal QA on the 5.16.5 version before pushing it live. I also wanted to have an "agent manager" orchestrate this, with the actual QA delegated to an agent (sub-agent).

I tried using Claude Code first, using Claude sub-agents and the `browser-tools \ browser-automation` skill. Across all three Claude Code surfaces (terminal, VS Code extension, Claude Code Desktop), this failed.
