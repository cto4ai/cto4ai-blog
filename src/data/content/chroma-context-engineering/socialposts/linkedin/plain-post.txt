Jeff Huber from Chroma hates the term "RAG" so much he convinced conference organizers to drop entire RAG tracks from events.

His alternative framing is much better: context engineering. Instead of thinking about retrieval and generation as separate steps, think about how to get the right information to your AI at the right time.

Here's something most people don't know: large context windows have a dirty secret called "context rot." When models operate on huge contexts repeatedly, they effectively lose their minds and stop following basic instructions.

This means those million-token context windows aren't the magic solution everyone thinks they are. You still need smart ways to select and rank the most relevant chunks.

The practical takeaway: if you want your AI systems to work reliably, invest in proper context engineering, not just throwing everything into a giant context.
