I think about my kit of electronic tools that support my work as "The Workflow." This huge backlog of workflow improvements I'd like to make lived in my head until June '25, when I started a "Workflow Tool ToDos" list in Obsidian, and I was making progress, with my Obsidian implementation as one example. But that progress was painfully slow.

Claude Opus 4.5 arrived in November, powering up Claude across all its surfaces---Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, and Claude Code. So smart, such encyclopedic knowledge. I used Opus, of course, when I ran into setup issues on tools like my Cursor IDE and Obsidian. But then it occurred to me: what if I made The Worflow itself a project, with many specific subprojects, and got very intentional about applying AI to level up?

That, along with Skillport, had been my spare time / AI learning time ever since.

aimed this powerful model at my list ofon dawned on me: that AI granted me the power to radically and continuously improve The Workflow, a series of projects. that I never would have been able to tackle on my own. Without AI, there's just too much hard-to-find knowledge needed, too much work involved for each improvement.

One of my deepest Workflow desires was to tune up my Claude Code setup, to use it the way that I knew it could be used. I'm guessing that I was tapping perhaps 15% to 20% of Claude Code's potential. time to execute, and expertise required, too little ti
