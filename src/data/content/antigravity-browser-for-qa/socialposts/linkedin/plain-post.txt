I recently posted about Kevin Hou's talk on Google DeepMind's Antigravity. After that deep dive, I decided to put it to work on automated browser QA of my blog.

After an Astro upgrade, I asked Antigravity to orchestrate a test of 30+ posts and site-wide functionality. It spun up its integrated Chrome browser, worked methodically through the pages, tested search, and delivered a clean QA report.

What stood out was how well-integrated the browser automation felt. Antigravity was built from the ground up for this kind of agent-driven browser work, and it shows.

The agent manager pattern is interesting too. My QA task ran in one conversation window while I could spin up other agent tasks in parallel. Still wrapping my head around that workflow, but it feels like the right architecture for orchestrating multiple autonomous tools.

I'd tried Claude Code first but couldn't get the browser automation working, likely a configuration issue on my end. Will revisit that setup, but Antigravity earned its A+ here.
