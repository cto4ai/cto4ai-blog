# LinkedIn Post Creation

Inputs:
- Source: main post at `content/{post-type}/{post-slug}/index.md` or a selected section of that post.

Output:
- Write the LinkedIn copy to `content/{post-type}/{post-slug}/socialposts/linkedin/post.txt`.
- If `post.txt` already exists, create `post-2.txt`, `post-3.txt`, etc. Do not overwrite existing files.

Steps:
1. Read front matter from the source post (`title`, `description`, `date`, optional `tags`). Determine the canonical URL for the post.
2. Draft 1–2 variants of LinkedIn copy:
   - Short variant: ~500 characters
   - Longer variant: ~1,000 characters (stay under LinkedIn’s 3,000 limit)
3. Structure each variant:
   - Hook line (1 strong sentence)
   - 1–3 succinct insights or takeaways (sentences or short bullets)
   - Call to action with the post URL (plain URL, not markdown)
   - 3–7 specific hashtags at the end
4. Style guidelines:
   - Professional, clear, and skimmable
   - Use plain URLs (no markdown links)
   - Break paragraphs with blank lines for readability
5. Images:
   - Select 1–3 relevant images from the post directory if available
   - Do not place images inline within the text
   - At the end of the file, add an “Images to attach” section listing filenames to upload in LinkedIn
6. Hashtags:
   - Prefer specific topics over generic ones (e.g., `#GenerativeAI` over `#AI`)
   - Include project-relevant tags when appropriate (e.g., `#CraftyCTO`, `#Hugo`, `#TailwindCSS`, `#EngineeringLeadership`)
7. Saving:
   - Ensure the destination directory exists: `socialposts/linkedin/`
   - Save using Unix line endings (LF)
8. Emojis
   - Use emojis on the title line and each major point
   - Use index-finger-pointing-right for the line with link URL

🐳 **Containing Agent Chaos: The Docker Creator's Next Act**

One of my favorite talks at #AIEWF2025 was Solomon Hykes, talking about his new creation Dagger in the session "Containing Agent Chaos." No AI hype here—Hykes has creds—he created Docker.

💥 **The Problem**: "An agent is an LLM **wrecking its environment** in a loop"

Running 1 agent? No problem. But try scaling to 10 agents - today's options are either "YOLO mode" or expensive cloud isolation.

🔧 **The Solution**: "Container use for agents" - not sandboxing, but complete isolated development environments where agents do their work entirely inside containers.

⚡ **The Tech Stack**: Containers + Git + Models = everything we need already exists, just needs native integration.

🎯 **The Live Demo**: Hykes spawned 6 Claude Code instances + 1 Goose instance, all iterating on a website project in complete isolation. Orchestrating developer can merge any instance's output they like.

🚀 **The Grand Finale**: Open-sourced a core element of Dagger—"container-use"—live on stage while agents were still spinning away!

The future of agent orchestration isn't about fancy UIs - it's about leveraging existing container/Git tech that humans barely use but agents can exploit perfectly.
