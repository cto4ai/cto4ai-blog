[CLI tools for working with ChatGPT and other LLMs](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/18/cli-tools-for-llms/) I installed Simon's llm, ttok, and strip-tags CLI tools and got them working, great stuff. Haven't used them yet beyond running variations of his examples, but glad to have this toolkit. Also grabbed shot-scraper, I know that will come in handy. And installed pipx, very cool.
