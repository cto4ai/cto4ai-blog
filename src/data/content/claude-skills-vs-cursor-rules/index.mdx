## CURSOR WRITTEN \*\*\*\* Introduction

As AI coding assistants become more sophisticated, the way we provide them with context about our projects has evolved. Two prominent approaches have emerged: Cursor Rules and Claude Skills. Both aim to solve the same fundamental problem—how do we give AI assistants the knowledge they need to work effectively within our specific codebases and workflows?

In this post, I'll share my experience evaluating Claude Skills as a potential alternative to Cursor Rules, exploring the strengths and limitations of each approach.

## What Are Cursor Rules?

Cursor Rules are markdown files (typically `.cursorrules` or files in `.cursor/rules/`) that provide context and guidelines to Cursor's AI assistant. They can include:

- Project structure and conventions
- Coding standards and best practices
- Framework-specific patterns
- Common workflows and commands
- Domain-specific knowledge

## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills, introduced by Anthropic, are a more structured approach to providing context to Claude. They offer:

- Formal skill definitions with metadata
- Structured knowledge organization
- Reusable components across projects
- Version control and sharing capabilities
