## Introduction

This [post from Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/) appeared on my radar yesterday morning and it hit a chord with me. AI coding tools are a research sweet spot for me--that is, I try very hard to stay up--and I've been working the new cloud-based tools from OpenAI and Anthropic into my workflows as much as possible.

## What to Call These Things?

Willison uses the term "asynchronous coding agents" and introduces that name by first introducing "coding agents" such as Claude Code and Codex CLI, and then explaining why their cloud siblings---OpenAI's Codex Cloud and Anthropic’s Claude Code on the web---open up a very different mode of operation. He uses the term "fire-and-forget" (apparently also used by Martin Fowler), and I think that's spot on.

I had misgivings about the mouth-feel of Willison's name, and decide to check in with a smart friend of mine. Opus 4.1, it turns out, has a solid understanding of the concept and how people are referring to it, and suggested that "autonomous coding agents" was in wide use and might be preferable. I concur.

## Coding Wars

Anthropic has invested heavily in the AI coding space. Its langauge models surprised many of us by jumping into the coding-model lead in June 2024 with the release of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and marched ahead with follow-on releases including Sonnet 4.5 just over a month ago. I have used Anthropic coding models almost exclusively since 3.5 Sonnet arrived.

Earlier this year, Anthropic jumped deeper into the fray with an actual coding tool, the minimalist coding agent Claude Code whose motto might be "get out of the way and let our great models do their thing." Not long after Claude Code arrived, it supplanted Cursor as my primary AI coding interface.

Where was OpenAI, the biggest AI player all, in all of this? Since 3.5 Sonnet arrived, playing catch-up. I had a lot of respect for OpenAI models generally, for ChatGPT as a productfor their strength with consumers and the robustness of their APIs and inference services, but coding belonged to Anthropic.

Over the past three months, though, the picture has been changing. OpenAI's GPT-5 release in August was huge, clearly a big step forward, and some were saying it rivaled Claude models for coding. OpenAI followed up with a coding-tuned model, GPT-5 Codex, in mid-September, and the coding buzz grew. OpenAI also released their own minimalist coding interface Codex in 2025.Anthropic struck back in late September with Sonnet 4.5, a substantial jump ahead of Sonnet 4 and still arguably the best coding model.

I might have ; generally and peopleand a big jump forward, Codex began to shown up on the radar, and what really grabbed me was hearing various OpenAI folks from CEO Greg Brockman to 's xxx, head of xxx, on the xxx podcast, talk about how OpenAI's internal team were using Codex in autonomous agent mode; fire-and-forget. She (was it brockman??) talked about going into meetings and people wanting a couple of minutes before the meeting started to fire off several Codex Cloud cruise missles that would work away during the meeting and be waiting with them when it finished with a pull request. Hearing stories like this repeatedly, my attitude about Codex went from "nah" to "crap, I need to work this in, alongside Claude Code ...." (As you'll see in a minute, the "alongside" part ended up being literally accurate.) t OpenAI DevDay, we sit down with Sherwin Wu and Christina Cai from the OpenAI Platform Team https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBGzWS1qd0

As I was suffering with "gotta get Codex set up" anxiety, Anthropic went and launched "Claude Code on the web" (it's hilarious how bad both OpenAI and Anthropic are with product names). Since I was double deep with Claude Code, getting its web counterpart set up was low effort, and CCOTW ended up being my first Autonomous Coding Agent experience. https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/claude-code-for-web/

But I didn't really get to my point yet: why are ACAs a big deal?

## Fire-and-forget That Works

In Claude Code the coding agent, you can already fire-and-forget. It's called YOLO mode. You turn off all protections, and let Claude do whatever it choose to, which in a command line or terminal interface, is pretty much anything. Nuke the system drive? Sure thing. Wipe the GitHub repo or more it public? Yep. Shut down your AWS cloud? Uh huh. Claude is a good AI-person, better than most, but YOLO mode is dangerous and developers understand the need to use it carefully. So we mostly do our important work in non-YOLO mode, which is a lot of carefully watching what the agent is doing in real time, with regular requests from the agent "can I take this potentially destructive action please?". I get a lot of code written when I pair with Claude Code, but while doing so I'm close to 100% occupied keeping close tabs on what Claude is up to.

What OpenAI and Anthropic really did with ACAs is give us (fairly) safe YOLO mode by equiping their agents with reasonably secure environments that the agent can go to town in, without risking much. "Go to town" means "run whatever you want, safely" -- usually called sandboxing -- but also "code whatever you want, safely -- you can't break anything." This works because the agent does its work in its own personal code space (technically a Git branch). Nothing there impacts our real code, until we've had a chance to carefully look at it and let it in (to be merged).

## Well-defined Specs, Well-equipped Environments

Willison's piece is pulling me the rest of the way into Autonomous Coding Agents; I did the research and set up my first custom Codex Cloud environment just now. Until now, I've been living with Codex's default setup with no customization and conservative default protections.
