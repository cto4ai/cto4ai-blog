I've been obsessed with reducing MCP token overhead lately. I even rewrote one server to cut it from 80+ tools down to 7, which made a huge difference with Claude's context limits.

But Mario Zechner takes it further: what if you just skip MCPs entirely and use Bash CLI tools instead? Models are already great at working with CLIs.

His example is chef's kiss: replacing the bloated Playwright MCP with four ultra-simple Bash commands. No ceremony, no overhead, just direct tool use.

The irony is that we're building complex abstractions (MCPs) when simpler solutions (CLIs) already work beautifully. Sometimes the best optimization is elimination.
