TWEET 1:
I knew my Claude Code setup needed work. I just didn't know where to start.

TWEET 2:
Then Boris Cherny - creator of Claude Code - posted a thread about how he personally uses it. Not documentation. Not a tutorial. Just: here's my actual setup, here's how I work.

TWEET 3:
First thing that hit me: no IDE. Just 5 terminal windows. Cherny writes Claude Code using Claude Code, apparently with little help from an IDE.

TWEET 4:
I followed his lead: CLI-first with iTerm2 + tmux, Cursor replaced with lightweight Zed, permissions configured. Just the first steps - but Claude Code already feels transformed.

TWEET 5:
Sometimes you just need to see how someone good at something actually does it. Cherny's thread was that for me.
