TWEET 1:
I spent Friday night migrating my Cursor Rules to Anthropic Skills in Claude Code, and it kind of blew my mind.

TWEET 2:
I thought I understood Skills from Claude.ai and Desktop. But Skills in Claude Code are way more powerful - they have discoverability through a marketplace, shareability via git, and composability with MCP servers.

TWEET 3:
The migration was harder than expected. Claude Code's first attempt violated Anthropic's core principles - brevity, progressive disclosure. Had to make it re-read skill-creator and self-critique. Credit where due: excellent work.

TWEET 4:
I ended up creating two Skills - one for blog scaffolding, one for embedding AI chat transcripts. Then Claude and I co-authored The Compleat Guide to Skills in Claude Code.

TWEET 5:
The big insight: Skills are optimized to conserve context. That alone is worth the migration, given how often context exhaustion kills productive sessions.
