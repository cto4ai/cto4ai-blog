🚀 **"Would you hire anyone who doesn't know how to search the web?" - Andrew Ng's powerful analogy for LLMs**

In a recent No Priors Podcast episode, Andrew Ng delivered a reality check that hit home: many leaders are still operating with 2022 workflows in a 2025 world.

🔍 **The Challenge**: Technology is moving so fast that what worked in 2022 simply doesn't work today. Yet many great leaders across different functions haven't adapted.

💪 **The New Baseline**: Just like web search became essential for any job role, LLM proficiency is now the new minimum bar for effectiveness in most positions.

⏰ **The Urgency**: We're "well past the point" where this is optional. The gap between LLM-savvy professionals and those still stuck in 2022 workflows is widening rapidly.

🎯 **The Question**: Are you and your team asking yourselves, "Is there anything we're doing today that we were also doing in 2022?" If so, it's time to take a hard look.

This isn't about jumping on AI hype—it's about recognizing that fundamental tools for getting work done have fundamentally changed.
