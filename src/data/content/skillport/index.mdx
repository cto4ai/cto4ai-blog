To explain why I created the open source project Skillport, I need to provide some background.

First, know that, starting in 2024 and throughout 2025, I've been working with clients to apply AI in critical business workflows, cobbling together Claude, lots of MCPs, and lots of large, complicated prompts. The results were often fantastic---what used to take days done in a few hours---but the cobbling together part was painful, as were the realities of deploying and running first-generation local MCPs.

Second, Skillport was made possible by Anthropic's great work during 2025, and we'll need to explore that a bit to set the stage, focusing on work related to what I call Skills++, the combination of:

- **Skills** are fantastic, but to be powerful they need ...
- **Tools**, often exposed over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), MCP, providing critical business context and data; and ...
- **Sandboxed code execution**, essential for advanced Skills and efficient tool use.

## Anthropic's Fantastic Year in Skills++

I asked [Claude Opus 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5) to give me Anthropic's 2025 timeline of important announcements and releases that pertained to Skills++:

## Skills: Domain Expertise Codified

Ironically, Anthropic demonstrated how great Skills could be---more than a month before Skills were officially announced.

On September 9th, Anthropic gave us Claude's incredible "create and edit files" feature, which enables direct creation and editing of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and PDF files right in Claude conversations. Little did we know that these capabilities were actually powered by Skills.

On October 16th, Anthropic launched Skills, and in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) (committed the day before the launch) you can see the actual Skills that power "create and edit files." These Skills are powerful, leveraging code execution with Python scripts and even XML schemas.

/>

At this point, it became clear that we were moving beyond the age of "cobbling together" Claude-based workflow solutions. Now we had an elegant abstraction for capturing the domain knowledge behind any business workflow. And Skills worked across all Claude surfaces: Claude.ai on the web, Claude Desktop on Mac and Windows, and Claude Code.

## Sharing Skills: Claude Code's Plugin Marketplaces

On November 3rd, Anthropic announced Plugin Marketplaces for Claude Code. Plugins are Anthropic's name for a category of artifacts that Claude Code users might want to create, reuse, and share, including slash commands, hooks, agents, and---you guessed it---Skills. Plugin Marketplaces are public git repositories hosted on GitHub, Gitlab, etc. that contain these artifacts, and that any Claude Code user can attach to and download from. Installing a Skill or other artifact takes just a command or two in Claude Code. The Plugin Marketplace repo design is another elegant piece of work by Anthropic and, among other things, supports Skill versioning.

<SingleImage

  alt="Claude Code Plugin Marketplaces announcement"
  postDir="skillport"
  size="2xl"
/>

Plugin Marketplaces were very exciting, but also a groaner, because they target only Claude Code CLI (read: developers running Claude Code in a terminal interface), and only work with public repositories, a non-starter for proprietary business workflows.

## Packaged, Context-friendly, Performant MCPs

Anthropic's Model Context Protocol has seen tremendous uptake and support, but it has faced significant challenges to adoption as well. In Claude.ai and Claude Desktop, MCPs have been difficult to install at best, and not available at all in some cases (local MCPs with Claude.ai). Every installed MCP, even if it's not being used, eats up precious model context tokens---the more tools the MCP exposes, the higher the context overhead. Finally, the standard model-to-MCP-tool back-and-forth tends to result in laggy performance.

Anthropic has been steadily chipping away at these MCP downsides.

On the MCP distribution front, Anthropic announced a standard for one-click-installable [Desktop Extensions](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions) (local MCPs) in June; followed on with [Connectors directory](https://www.anthropic.com/news/connectors-directory), supporting one-click installs of cross-platform Remote MCPs, in July; and in November launched [MCP Bundles (MCPB)](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-20-adopting-mcpb/), the successor to Desktop Extensions. By end of year, the official Connectors directory was solidly populated with MCPs for many major platforms:

<SingleImage
  src="claude_ai_browse_connectors.png"
  alt="Claude.ai Connectors directory showing available MCP integrations"
  postDir="skillport"
  size="2xl"
/>

On the context efficiency and performance fronts, November was a big month: possibly spurred by [Cloudflare's "Code Mode" research](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp), Anthropic began recommending and supporting a radically context-efficient and performant mode of model-to-MCP interaction, [Programmatic Tool Calling](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use). In a nutshell, instead of the model directly interacting with MCP tools, sifting and sorting their outputs, gobbling up huge chunks of context, the model instead **writes code** that does all that. As a result, the model no longer bears the context weight of all the intermediate tool call results, and no longer incurs the performance penalties of long, chatty conversations with tools. Anything that improves MCPs and tool calling is a big win for Skills++.

## Ubiquitous, Sandboxed Code Execution in the Cloud

If you're going to have powerful skills like "create and edit files" that use scripts, or get the benefit of Programmatic Tool Calling, you need a place to run code---one that works on all Claude surfaces, including Claude.ai on the web. Anthropic anticipated this need and began delivering on it in May, with Code Execution (of Python scripts) arriving as part of the Claude 4 platform. In August, Claude added the ability to run Bash scripts and perform file system operations. All of the above were prerequisites for Skills generally and the "create and edit files" Skills specifically, which launched just a few weeks later. October brought us Claude Code on the Web, a long-running-agent-loop mode for Claude Code that was completely reliant on sandboxed code execution in the cloud, as well as sandbox networking with egress controls.

Finally, in December, Anthropic acquired Bun, known for its blazingly fast JavaScript/TypeScript runtime that dramatically outperforms Node.js on startup time and execution speed. The acquisition signaled Anthropic's commitment to owning the code execution layer that Skills++ depends on. Fast, lightweight runtimes are essential when you're spinning up thousands of ephemeral sandboxes for Programmatic Tool Calling and Skill execution across all Claude surfaces.

## The Christmas Itch That Needed Scratching

All of these great announcements and releases, so much promise ... but heading into the end of year lull, I still didn't quite have what I needed to really do business workflow automations right and to help clients deploy Skills at scale.

The main gap, to me, was Skill distribution and sharing. I wanted the elegance of Plugin Marketplaces, e.g. git repo based with Skill versioning, but without the public repo constraint and supporting all Claude surfaces. Would it be feasible to create a project that extends the Plugin Marketplace concept to support private repos, authentication, and get it working across all Claude surfaces?

For me, there's always another question as well: would I learn something in the process?

The answer to both questions seems like YES, so far at least. Here's what I built.

## Skillport: Claude Skill Sharing at Scale

Skillport helps organizations deploy, share, and manage Skills at scale and without limits:

- Works across all Claude surfaces:
  - Claude.ai
  - Claude Desktop
  - Claude Mobile[^1]
  - Claude Code
  - Claude Code on the Web[^2]
    [^1]: Skills that run on Claude Mobile must be installed using Claude.ai or Claude Desktop
    [^2]: Skillport authentication for Claude Code on the web happens in Claude Code CLI
- Supports "normal Skill user" operations: find, install, update Skills.
- Supports "Skill creator / editor" operations: create, edit, version-bump, and delete Skills.
- Skill repositories use Anthropic's Plugin Marketplace format, ensuring compatibility
- Private repositories are supported, enabling secure sharing within an organization (including Claude Code)
- Skillport's Claude-compatible Connector carries the lowest possible Claude context overhead: one tool only
- Claude's user interactions with Skillport are guided by Skillport's own skill
- Skills are versioned and users can check to see if upgrades are available to any installed Skill

### Open Source, MIT License

Skillport was released publicly on GitHub on January 4th 2025 under the MIT license, and consists of two repos:

- `skillport-connector`, which enables an organization using Skillport to create their own Claude Connector (remote MCP) that authenticates over OAuth and provides access to a complete API for installing and managing Skills. The initial version supports Google OAuth and deploys to Cloudflare workers, but fork the repo and have at it, extending to other OAuth IdPs and deployment targets should be low-effort
- `skillport-marketplace`, a GitHub template that creates an Anthropic Plugin Marketplace compliant repository where organizations can (privately!) manage their library of Skills

### The Skillport Skill

Skillport uses Skills itself, and in a rather novel way. The `skillport-connector` exposes just a single tool to Claude -- authentication -- and guides Claude to download and install the `skillport` Skill. With that Skill installed, Claude has full knowledge of how to interact with Skillport and use the full suite of Skill management tools. Claude-to-Skillport interactions take place via Programmatic Tool Calling rather than high-context-overhead MCP tools.

I learned a lot, I suspect Skillport will be useful for my fractional CTO clients, and I hope others find it helpful too.
