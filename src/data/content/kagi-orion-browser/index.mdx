[Orion Browser by Kagi](https://browser.kagi.com/) I'm late to the party, probably, but the Orion browser from Kagi (makers of the excellent paid search engine) is really interesting. WebKit-based, super lightweight, zero telemetry / auto ad blocking. And it supports both Firefox and Chrome browser extensions (or at least quite a few of them). Still considered beta but caught my attention for sure. The [benchmarks are pretty wild](https://browser.kagi.com/faq.html).
