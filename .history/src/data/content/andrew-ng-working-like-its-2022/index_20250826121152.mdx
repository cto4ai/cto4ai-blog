> I think it's a challenge for a lot of people. I know many great leaders in lots of different functions still doing things the way they were in 2022. And I think it's just got to change. When new technology comes, I mean, once upon a time, there was no such thing as web search today. Would you hire anyone for any role that doesn't know how to search the web, right? And I think we're well past the point that for a lot of job roles, if you can't use LLMs in an effective way, you're just much less effective than someone that can.
