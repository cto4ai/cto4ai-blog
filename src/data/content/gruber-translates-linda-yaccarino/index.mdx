A few prime translations:

> It's OK to day-drink. I am.

> I used to run all advertising for NBCUniversal. Now I'm running an $8/month multi-level marketing scheme where the only users who've signed up are men who own a collection of MAGA hats.

> As if this rebranding disaster isn't enough, our infrastructure is crumbling. Facebook took Threads from 0 to 100 million users in under a week, without a hitch, at the same time we imposed comical rate limits on usage. I mean can you even believe that shit? I still can't. I said to him, "Elon, we are an ad-based business. Our revenue is directly commensurate to usage. This is like running a casino and turning the slot machines off to save on the electricity bill. It makes no sense." And Elon was like "Bots!"

> Please quit. Get out. I beg you. Leave while you can put on your resume that you worked for "Twitter".
