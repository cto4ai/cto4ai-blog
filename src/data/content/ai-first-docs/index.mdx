A progression of insights:

- "Docs-as-code" AKA "Markdown[^1] in a repo" is the best replacement for whatever closed documentation platform you're currently using and hate (looking at you, Confluence)
- In the AI world that's emerging, The Knowledge needs to be written down (that is, captured in electronic documents) in a format that language models digest and understand accurately and efficiently, stored in a place that language models are highly trained to use, and carefully managed.
- Whoa. "Docs-as-code" AKA "Markdown in a repo" is a perfect fit for this. Markdown is arguably the content format most naturally understood by a language model, and a Git/GitHub repo a very robust content store and version control system that every LLM can interact with naturally. Stretch "docs-as-code" to mean "documents" and we have a winner.
- Uh oh. Having The Knowledge in Markdown in a repo is a start, but it's got huge gaps. How do my non-coder business users create and edit those documents? How do everyday users get to those documents? How do I cross-link documents? Start chasing solutions like MkDocs published to GitHub Pages. See our simple, elegant solution grow complex and awkward.
- Whoa. We're doing this Because AI, right? What if AI were the missing link here? What if our primary interface to our documents became the AI?
- I should try building this. But beware of The Bitter Lesson.

## Into Action: Building the "AI First Docs" Framework

Early on in the above progression, I had recommended the docs-as-code approach as a better place to manage their documents (starting with their AI policies!) and promised to set them up. One's a Claude shop, the other ChatGPT--- though in both cases I've been careful to make sure they both are also keeping tabs on "the other guy" and be prepared to switch if needed. two of my fractional CTO clients have been in need of a traditional docs-as-code solution

Now we have arrived at the subject of our post: AI First Docs.

- That sure sounds like "docs-as-code" with Markdown, doesn't it?
- If we expand "docs-as-code" to mean "documents as code"
- I thereby expand "docs as code" Markdown is arguable a perfect content format for The Knowledge  
  keeping The Knowledge Markdown-in-repo

I have been feeling that docs-as-code is important in the

Documentation has always been the necessary evil of software development. We've evolved from Word documents to docs-as-code, making documentation more maintainable and version-controlled. But what if we're thinking too small?

The next frontier isn't just better documentation tools—it's AI-first documentation that fundamentally changes how we create, maintain, and consume knowledge about our systems.

## The Limits of Docs-as-Code

Traditional docs-as-code improved documentation by bringing it closer to the code, but it still treats documentation as a static artifact. We write markdown files that describe our systems, but they quickly become stale, incomplete, or overwhelming.

The problems persist:

- Documentation requires manual effort to create and maintain
- It's often written after-the-fact and lacks context
- Finding the right information requires knowing where to look
- Updates lag behind actual code changes

## Enter AI-First Documentation

AI-first documentation flips the paradigm. Instead of documenting what we built, we build systems that can explain themselves dynamically and contextually.

This means:

- **Self-describing systems** that can answer questions about their own architecture
- **Context-aware explanations** that adapt to the user's role and current task
- **Living documentation** that updates automatically as code changes
- **Conversational interfaces** for exploring complex systems

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Imagine asking your codebase: "How does authentication work in this system?" and getting a response that includes relevant code snippets, architecture diagrams, and explanations tailored to whether you're debugging, onboarding, or implementing a new feature.

Or documentation that proactively suggests updates when it detects code changes that might affect existing explanations.

## The Technical Foundation

Building AI-first documentation requires several key components:

1. **Code understanding models** that can parse and explain code semantics
2. **Knowledge graphs** that map relationships between system components
3. **Context engines** that understand user intent and current workspace
4. **Natural language generation** for clear, adaptive explanations

## Beyond Documentation: Intelligent Development Environments

The real opportunity isn't just better docs—it's development environments that understand what you're trying to accomplish and can guide you through complex systems intelligently.

This is the future we're building toward: not just code that works, but code that can teach, explain, and guide us through its own complexity.

_What aspects of AI-first documentation are you most excited about? What challenges do you see in making this vision reality?_
