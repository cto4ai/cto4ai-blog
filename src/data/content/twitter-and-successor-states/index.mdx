I love the tone of this article, a true pleasure to read---highly recommended. A couple of great lines:

> I mean it's really funny how a bunch of very rich dudes are breaking stuff online and making worse versions of existing products in response to said breakage. Obviously it is quite amusing to be shown how stupid rich people are, and I very much enjoy it.

> This is much like Elon Musk, as are dogs who chase cars and catch them, presumably. After being tricked into paying way more money for Twitter than it is worth he had to figure out some way to keep it ticking over and also to service all the debt that he took on to buy it. So because he is, and I cannot stress this enough, really quite stupid, he began to strip out all the load bearing members of staff who did stuff like not make the website DDOS itself.

The lead plate is fun too, "Vengeance of Clovis":
