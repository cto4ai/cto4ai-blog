I kicked off my [recent post](leveling-up-claude-code-with-boris-chernys-help) about leveling up my Claude Code game as follows:

<Aside>

I think about the kit of electronic tools that support my work as "The Workflow" and man, did I have a lot of ideas for new tools, improvements, and fixes. This 2XL-sized backlog lived in my head until June '25, when I started a "Workflow Tool ToDos" list in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I made progress here and there, with my Obsidian implementation as one example. But movement was more sloth than cheetah.

[Claude Opus 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5) arrived in November, powering up Claude across all its surfaces---Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, and Claude Code. So smart, such encyclopedic knowledge. I used Opus, of course, when I ran into setup issues on tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) and Obsidian. But then it occurred to me: what if I made The Workflow itself a project, with a number of specific subprojects, and got very intentional about applying AI to level up?

This turned into a rich vein of gold that I've been mining ever since, and actually led to my largest AI side projects to date, including [Skillport](skillport). AI granted me the power to radically and continuously improve The Workflow, something I never would have been able to tackle on my own---without my AI pair, there's just too much hard-to-find knowledge needed, too much work involved for each improvement.

</Aside>

Connecting the dots, moving from "I wish I could do something about X" to "I can definitely now do something about X---and Y and Z and A-B-C," is a huge deal. AI is the enabler, but more specifically, the November arrival of Claude Opus 4.5 was, for me, the tipping point. That model crossed some kind of "smart enough" line where there was literally not a workflow challenge it cannot take on.

Below I'll outline how I've paired with Opus to tackle The Workflow.

## The Workflow has a Git Repo

When I realized that I could start collaborating with Claude on The Workflow, one of my first steps was creating `the-workflow`, a Git repository for the overall project, with numerous folders for individual subprojects. This turned out to be a very important step, because, in following good Claude Code practices for a repo, I created a CLAUDE.md with broad information about all my Workflow initiatives, and in each subproject, a well-stocked /docs directory. The result: the Claude Code that I run inside `the-workflow` repo is insanely smart about all aspects of my setup.

## Shut Your Pi-hole

I use Pi-hole running on a Raspberry Pi to block ads on our home network. Sometime in the past month, I noticed my iPhone began getting ads, while on the home network ... what the heck?

I had a little chat with Workflow Claude, and figured out that my recent upgrade to iOS 26 resulted in a new default setting "Limit IP Address Tracking" that bypassed local DNS and prevented Pi-hole from doing its thing. Toggled off, fixed.

I also took the opportunity to capture Pi-hole setup documentation. One benefit of pairing with Claude Code in a terminal is that it has SSH access, so it was able to SSH in to the Pi and capture lots of details about the config. I also fed it some documentation I had done in Obsidian. So now Workflow Claude knows all about Pi-hole, my DNS setup, we well as other problems and upgrades on the Pi-hole todo list.

## Connecting Obsidian to All Claudes

I use Obsidian across all my machines and devices for note-taking, bookmarking, task tracking, podcast snip librarying, and more. I figured I should connect Obsidian to Claude and so I could put Claude to work on finding, organizing, and creating Obsidian content.

I went a bit crazy on this project, deciding I wanted **all** Claude surfaces including Claude.ai to have Obsidian access. But Claude.ai lives in the cloud, not on my local computer and network like Claude Desktop and Claude Code, how could I get this to work?

With Workflow Claude's help, we worked out an architecture that involved:

- A docker based Obsidian instance running on my Synology NAS, along with the Obsidian REST API
- A Tailscale funnel into that NAS using my personal Tailscale network
- An authentication proxy that blocks unauthenticated traffic to Obsidian on the NAS
- Since I learned how to build Claude Connectors (OAuth MCPs) as part of the [Skillport](skillport) project, an OAuth MCP to authenticate into the NAS
- A Claude Obsidian Skill that helps Claude understand how to reach Obsidian content

I say I went a bit crazy here---well, not really. One of my main responsibilities as an AI-aware CTO is to know the boundaries of what is and is not possible with AI. The overkill here in fully connecting Obsidian with all Claude surfaces was also an opportunity to see how smooth or rough this multi-layer implementation what kindAnd we built it! It works! Obsidian from any Claude including Claude.ai.

## IDE or No IDE? Which IDE?

work through The my Workflow tune-up activities

The revelation that this a huge body of fixing-and-automating that is The Workflow is now entirely within my grasp , until now, I would have been blocked from embarking on due to the sheer size of the work The Claude Code post covered some aspects of The Workflow already, but there are more
