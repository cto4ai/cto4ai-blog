# Anthropic 2025 Announcements: Skills & Tools Relevance

| Date | Announcement | Why Important for Skills & Tools |
|------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Aug 25 | Code Execution update — Bash + file ops (`code_execution_20250825`) | **Foundation for Skills runtime.** Skills need to execute code, not just generate it. Bash support means Skills can run shell scripts, install packages, and manipulate files — the primitives that make document-creation Skills possible. |
| Sep 9 | Create and edit files — Skills-powered file creation (preview) | **Skills' first killer app.** This feature is entirely powered by Skills internally (docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf). Proves the Skills architecture works for end-users, not just developers. |
| Sep 29 | Claude Agent SDK | **Skills infrastructure goes public.** The Agent SDK is the same runtime that powers Claude Code. Now any developer can build agents with the same primitives Anthropic uses internally. |
| Oct 16 | **Skills launch** — Public Skills + /v1/skills API | **The main event.** Skills become a first-class API primitive. Developers can create, version, and deploy Skills. Enterprise customers can manage Skills organization-wide. |
| Oct 21 | Create and edit files GA — Network/egress controls | **Enterprise-ready Skills execution.** Admins can control what Skills can access (package managers only, allowlisted domains, or full internet). Critical for regulated industries. |
| Oct 27 | Claude for Excel — Excel add-in (research preview) | **Skills meet enterprise workflows.** Excel is where finance actually happens. An Excel Skill that understands workbooks, formulas, and cell references is a template for domain-specific Skills. |
| Nov 4 | **Code execution with MCP** — Engineering blog | **The conceptual foundation.** Explains why presenting MCP tools as code APIs (instead of direct tool calls) dramatically reduces token overhead. Explicitly connects to Skills — agents can persist reusable code with SKILL.md files. This paper laid the groundwork for Advanced Tool Use two weeks later. |
| Nov 20 | **Advanced Tool Use** — Tool Search Tool, Programmatic Tool Calling | **Patterns that apply to Skills and MCP.** Skills frequently pair with MCP servers, and these patterns — deferred loading, on-demand discovery, programmatic orchestration — apply directly to that layer. We've already adapted these concepts within Skillport. |
| Nov 24 | Opus 4.5 — 80.9% SWE-bench, $5/$25 pricing | **Better model + lower prices = more Skill usage.** 67% price cut on Opus makes complex, multi-Skill workflows economically viable. |
| Nov 24 | Claude for Excel — Beta expands to all Max, Team, Enterprise | **Excel Skill matures.** Adds pivot tables, charts, file uploads. Validates the "Skill as Office add-in" pattern at broader scale. |
| Nov 25 | MCP Nov spec — Async ops, registry, extensions | **MCP becomes Skill-compatible.** Async operations mean long-running Skills don't block. Extensions framework hints at Skill-like modularity in the protocol itself. Registry shows how discovery could work. |
| Dec 3 | Bun acquisition | **Anthropic is serious about tooling.** Acquiring a JavaScript runtime signals investment in the execution layer that Skills depend on. |
| Dec 9 | MCP → Linux Foundation — AAIF with OpenAI, Block, Google, Microsoft | **Skills' transport layer is now neutral.** MCP under Linux Foundation means Skills can flow across any platform that adopts MCP. Anthropic can't be accused of lock-in. Competitors have to adopt or fragment. |
| Dec 18 | **Agent Skills open standard** — Portable Skills, enterprise admin | **Skills become portable.** Skills built for Claude work in ChatGPT, Cursor, or any adopting platform. This is the "write once, run anywhere" moment for agent capabilities. Partner directory (Atlassian, Notion, Figma) shows ecosystem momentum. |
