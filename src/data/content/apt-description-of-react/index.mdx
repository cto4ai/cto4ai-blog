> React on the other hand feels like a pot warming up and we're the frogs being boiled alive at this point. You can write some perfectly valid, but naive React code and it's going to have some footguns. We're so used to write idiomatic React code we don't even notice that anymore. You learn to use stable references in callback functions, to be careful using Context, and so on. But the list is not short, and it only grows.
