To explain why I created the open source project Skillport, I need to provide some background.

First, know that, starting in 2024 and throughout 2025, I had been working with clients to apply AI in critical business workflows, cobbling together Claude, lots of MCPs, and lots of large, complicated prompts. The results were often fantastic---what used to take days done in a few hours---but the cobbling together part was painful, as were the realities of deploying and running first-generation local MCPs.

Second, we need to look at what was going on at Anthropic in 2025, focusing on what I call Skills++: Skills plus Tools plus Code Execution:

- **Skills** are fantastic, but to be powerful they need ...
- **Tools**, often exposed over the Model Context Protocol, MCP), which give Skill access to critical business context and data; and ...
- **Sandboxed code execution**, which is essential for efficient tool use, and necessary to provide Skill feature parity across all Claude surfaces including Claude.ai on the web.

So:

## Anthropic's Fantastic Year in Skills++

I asked Claude Opus 4.5 to give me Anthropic's 2025 timeline of important announcements and releases that pertained to Skills++:

Bundles now work in any MCP-compatible app, not just Claude. Same week as Advanced Tool Use — the distribution format matures alongside the usage patterns.                                                                    |

## Skills: Domain Expertise Codified

Ironically, Anthropic demonstrated how great Skills could be---more than a month before Skills were officially announced.

On September 9th, Anthropic have us Claude's incredible "create and edit files" feature, which enables direct creation and editing of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and PDF files right in Claude conversations. Little did we know that these capabilities were actually powered by Skills.

On October 16th, Anthropic launched Skills, and in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) (committed the day before the launch) you can see the actual Skills that power "create and edit files." These Skills are powerful, leveraging code execution with Python scripts and evem XML schemas.

/>

At this point, it became clear that we were moving beyond the age of "cobbling together" Claude-based workflow solutions. Now we had an elegant abstraction for capturing the domain knowledge behind any business workflow. And Skills worked across all Claude surfaces: Claude.ai on the web, Claude Desktop on Mac and Windows, and Claude Code.

## Sharing Skills: Claude Code's Plugin Marketplaces

On November 3rd, Anthropic announced Plugin Marketplaces for Claude Code. Plugins are Anthropic's name for a category of artifacts that Claude Code users might want to create, reuse, and share, including slash commands, hooks, agents, and---you guessed it---Skills. Plugin Marketplaces are public git repositories hosted on GitHub, Gitlab, etc. that contain these artifacts, and that any Claude Code user can attach to and download from. Installing a Skill or other artifact takes just a command or two in Claude Code. The Plugin Marketplace repo design is another elegant piece of work by Anthropic and, among other things, supports Skill versioning.

Plugin Marketplaces were very exciting, but also a groaner, because they target only Claude Code CLI (read: developers running Claude Code in a terminal interface), and only work with public repositories, a non-starter for proprietary business workflows.

## Packaged, Context-friendly, Performant MCPs

Anthropic's Model Context Protocol has seen tremendous uptake and support, but it has faced significant challenges to adoption as well. In Claude.ai and Claude Desktop, MCPs have been difficult to install at best, and not available at all in some cases (local MCPs with Claude.ai). Every installed MCP, even if it's not being used, eats up precious model context tokens---the more tools the MCP exposes, the higher the context overhead. Finally, the standard model-to-MCP-tool back-and-forth tends to result in laggy performance.

Anthropic has been steadily chipping away at these MCP downsides.

On the MCP distribution front, Anthropic announced a standard for one-click-installable Desktop Extensions (local MCPs) in June; followed on with Connectors directory, supporting one-click installs of cross-platform Remote MCPs, in July; and in November launched MCP Bundles (MCPB), the successor to Desktop Extensions. By end of year, the official Connectors directory was solidly populated with MCPs for many major platforms:

<SingleImage
  src="claude_ai_browse_connectors.png"
  alt="Claude.ai Connectors directory showing available MCP integrations"
  postDir="skillport"
  size="2xl"
/>

On the context efficiency and performance fronts, November was a big month: possibly spurred by [Cloudflare's "Code Mode" research](#), Anthropic began recommending and supporting a radically context-efficient and performant mode of model-to-MCP interaction, Programmatic Tool Calling. In a nutshell, instead of the model directly interacting with MCP tools, sifting and sorting their outputs, gobbling up huge chunks of context, the model instead **writes code** that does all that. As a result, the model no longer bears the context weight of all the intermediate tool call results, and no longer incurs the performance penalties of long, chatty conversations tools. spins its wheels running long sequences of tool calls, with the added benefit the code runs much faster. Anything that improves MCPs and tool calling is a big win for Skills++.

## Ubiquitous, Sandboxed Code Execution in the Cloud

If you're going to have powerful skills like "create and edit files" that use scripts, or get the benefit of Programmatic Tool Calling, you need a place to run code---one that works on all Claude surfaces, including Claude.ai on the web. Anthropic anticipated this need and began delivering on it in May, with Code Execution (of Python scripts) arriving as part of the Claude 4 platform. In August, Claude added the ability to run Bash scripts and perform file system operations. All of the above were prerequisites for Skills generally and the "create and edit files" Skills specifically, which launched just a few weeks later. October brought us Claude Code on the Web, a long-running-agent-loop mode for Claude Code that was completely reliant on sandboxed code execution in the cloud, as well as sandbox networking with egress controls.

Finally, in December, Anthropic acquired Bun, known for its blazingly fast JavaScript/TypeScript runtime that dramatically outperforms Node.js on startup time and execution speed. The acquisition signaled Anthropic's commitment to owning the code execution layer that Skills++ depends on. Fast, lightweight runtimes are essential when you're spinning up thousands of ephemeral sandboxes for Programmatic Tool Calling and Skill execution across all Claude surfaces.

## The Christmas Itch That Needed Scratching

All of these great announcements and releases, so much promise ... but heading into the end of year lull, I still didn't quite have what I needed to really do business workflow automations right and to help clients deploy Skills at scale.

The main problem was Skill distribution and sharing. For business users running Claude.ai or Claude Desktop, there wasn't any kind of a sharing solution---other than trading .skill files over Slack or email. Versioning skills? Nope. Even for Claude Code users, Plugin Marketplaces were untenable for Skills that involved proprietary processes or information, due to the requirement that repos be public.

I loved the design of Plugin Marketplaces, their elegant, standardized repo structure and support for versioning. Could I possibly build something that would apply this great design and bring these features to Claude business users?

For me, there's always another question as well: would I learn something in the process?

The answer to both questions turned out to be YES.

## Skillport: Filling the Skills Distribution Gaps

Skillport was released publicly on January 4th under the MIT license, and consists of two repos:

- `skillport-connector`, which enables an organization using Skillport to create their own Claude Connector (remote MCP) that authenticates over OAuth and provides access to a complete API for installing and managing Skills
- `skillport-marketplace`, a GitHub template that creates an Anthropic Plugin Marketplace compatible repository where organizations can (privately!) manage their library of Skills

Skillport uses Skills itself, and in a rather novel way.
