Last week, the news cycle[^1] collided with my post on Claude Agent Skills. This week, perhaps I'm having better luck: the lead session of the CODE track at last week's AI Engineer Code Summit was Anthropic's Barry Zhang & Mahesh Murag speaking on that exact topic.

## 15 Minutes of Pure Gold

The amount of information that Zhang and Murag fit into their 15 minute slot was impressive. As someone deeply engaged in the Anthropic / Claude / Claude Code / Skills ecosystem, I wanted to wring every drop out of this session. It took several viewings to get it all, but was well worth the effort.

## Old and New Ways of Thinking About Agents

Zhang makes the point:

> After we built Claude Code, we realized that Code is actually a general purpose agent. Think about generating a financial report.The model can call the API to pull in data and do research. It can organize that data in the file system. It can analyze it with Python and synthesize the insights in old file format all through code. The core scaffolding can suddenly become as thin as just bash and file system. Which is great and really scalable---but we very quickly run into a different problem.

## The Missing Link: Domain Expertise

Given a powerful, general purpose agent, the world's the limit. Except for the small issue of domain expertise. As Zhang points out, "Agents can't absorb your expertise really well, and they don't learn over time."

Skills are all about encapsulating domain expertise.

## Defining Skills

I love Skills by definition.

They're as simple as a single markdown file with a tiny bit of front matter. The "complex" example above has a main SKILL.md, a couple of reference files, and a Python script.

## Code Can Be Better Than Tools

Agents have traditional used tools. But tools have significant drawbacks:

> Traditonal tools have a lot of problems: poorly written instructions, are pretty ambiguous. When model is struggling, it can't really make a change to the tool. Always live in the context window.

It turns out that scripts contained within Skills have substantial benefits versus traditional tools.

Scripts (code), on the other hand,

> Code solves some of these issues: It's self-documenting, it is modifiable and can live in the file system until they are really needed and used.

### Anthropic's Barry Zhang & Mahesh Murag argue for building Skills, not Agents

#### Stop Building Agents, Build Skills Instead

- These two created Agent Skills
- Moving towards tighter coupling between the model and the runtime environment
- Used to think about (ss)
- Agent underneath is actually more universal than we thought
- Code is the universal interface (as in Claude Code)
  - Realized Claude Code is a General Purpose Agent 25:20
- Missing link: Domain expertise: Agents can't absorb your expertise really well, and they don't learn over time
- That's why we created Agent Skills
  - Def: Skills are organized collections of files that package composable procedural knowledge for agents
- Simplicity: folders and files
- Skills can include scripts as tools
  - Traditonal tools have a lot of problems: poorly written instructions, are pretty ambiguous. When model is struggling, it can't really make a change to the tool. Always live in the context window.
  - Code solves some of these issues: It's self-documenting, it is modifiable and can live in the file system until they are really needed and used.
- Skills ecosystem
  - Foundational skills
    - To start, foundational skills are those that give agents new capabilities or domain specific capabilities that it didn't have before.
    - We ourselves with our launch built document skills that give Claude the ability to create and edit professional quality office documents.
    - Cadence build scientific research skills that give Claude new capabilities like EHR data analysis and using common Python bioinformatics libraries better than it could before.
  - Partner skills
    - Browserbase built skill for their open source browser automation tool StageHand. Now Claude hooked up, navigate to the web and more effectively get work done.
      - NO MCP!!
  - Enterprise skills
    - Fortune 100s
      - Using skills as a way to teach agents about organizational best practices and the weird and unique ways that they use this bespoke internal software
      - We're also talking to really large developer productivity teams. These teams serving thousands or even tens of thousands of developers in an organization that are using skills as a way to deploy agents like claude code and teach them about code style best practices and other ways that they want their developers to work internally.
  - Common to all
    - Anyone can create them; and they give agents new capabilities that they didn't have before.
- Trends
  - More complex, production-grade skills
  - Complementing the existing ecosystem of MCPs
    - Developers are using and building sklls that orchestrate workflows of multiple MCP tools stitched together to do more complex things with external data and connectivity. In these cases, MCP is providing the connection to the outside world, while Skills are providing the expertise.
  - Skills that are being built by people that aren't technical. These are people that are in functions like finance, recruiting, accounting, legal, and a lot more.
    - Early validation of our initial idea that skills help people that aren't doing coding work extend these general agents and they make these agents more accessible for the day-to-day of what these people are wroking on.
- Complete picture / architecture
  - Agent loop
    - The loop that manages the agent's internal context and manages what toekns are going in and out
    - And this is coupled with a runtime environment that provides the agent with a file system and the ability to read and write code
    - Agent can be connected to MCP servers. Tools and data from the outside world that make the agent more relevant and effective.
    - Now, we can give the same agent a library of hundreds or thousands of skills that it can decide to pull into context only at runtime when it's deciding to work on a particular task.
    - Today, giving an agent a new capability in a new domain might just involve equipping it with the right set of MCP servers and the right library of skills.
  - This emerging pattern of an agent with an MCP server and a set of skills is something that's already helping us at Anthropic deploy Claude to new verticals. Just after we launched Skills 5 weeks ago, we immediately launched new offerings in financial services and life sciences.
- Skills evolving
  - Starting to treat skills like we treat software.
    - This means exploring testing and evaluation. Rights skills at right time; measure output quality of an agent equipped with the skill to make sure that's on par with what the agent is supposed to be doing.
    - We'd also like to focus on versioning. As a skill evolves and the resulting agent behavior evolves, we want this to be clearly tracked and to have a clear lineage over time.
    - Finally, want to explore skills that can explicitly depend on and refer to either other skills, MCP servers, and dependencies and packages within the agent's environment. We thinking that tjis is going to make agents a lot more predictable in different runtime environments and the composabilty of multiple skills together will help agents like Claude elicit even more complex and relevant behavior from these agents.
- Sharing and distribution
  - Lots of thinking about companies that are deploying these agents at scale. And the vision that excites us most is one of a collective and evolving knolwedge base of capabilities that's curated by people and agents inside of an organization. We think skills are a big step towards this vision. They provide the procedural knowledge for your agents to do useful things. And as you interact with an agent and give it feedback and more institutional knowledge, it starts to get better, and all of the agents inside your team and your org get better as well. And when someone joins your team and starts using Claude for the first time, it already knows that your team cares about. It knows about your day-to-day and it knows how to be most effective for the work that you're doing. And as this grows and this ecosystem starts to develop even more, this compounding value is going to extend outisde of just your org and into the broader community. So just liek when someone else across the world builds and MCP server that makes your agent more useful, a skill built by someone else in the community will help make your own agents more capable, reliable, and useful as well.
- This vision of evolving knowledge base gets even more powerful when Claude starts to create these skills. (Slide) Claude can acquire new capabilities instantly, evolve them as needed, and then drop the ones that become obsolete. Power of in-context learning makes this a lot more cost effective for information that changes on a daily basis. Skill creator skill; continue pushing in that direction.
- Agent stack - computing stack comparison
  - Models = CPUs
  - Agents = OSs
  - Skills = Applications
- Closing
  - Converging on a general architecture for general agents. Time stop rebuilding agents and start building skills
