## Introduction

When I first started exploring Claude Code, I noticed many developers were familiar with using `.cursorrules` files in Cursor IDE to customize AI behavior. Coming from that background, I wondered: what's the equivalent in Claude Code?

The answer is **Skills** - but they're far more powerful than simple instruction files. Skills in Claude Code are:

- **Portable** across Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, and Claude Code
- **Discoverable** through a plugin marketplace ecosystem
- **Shareable** with your team via git or plugin repositories
- **Progressive** - they load only what's needed to minimize token usage
- **Composable** - they work alongside MCP servers, slash commands, and subagents

To help bridge this gap, I asked Claude.ai to create a comprehensive guide explaining Skills from the perspective of someone already familiar with Claude.ai and Claude Desktop. The result is the complete reference below.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand how Skills work in Claude Code, you can start migrating your `.cursorrules` workflows:

1. **Identify repeatable patterns** in your Cursor rules
2. **Create Skills** for each distinct workflow or methodology
3. **Use skill-creator** to help structure them properly
4. **Share with your team** via project-level `.claude/skills/` directory

The beauty of Skills is that they're not just local configuration - they're shareable, discoverable knowledge that can benefit your entire team.
