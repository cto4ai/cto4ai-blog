# Named Entity Linking with Playwright

ToDos:

- link to other content in the blog is fine, look for self-references such as "my AI Engineer World's Fair write-ups"
- people links: if LinkedIn, need to make sure this is the right person

**Task**: Use web search and Playwright to add markdown links for all important non-obvious named entities in a blog post, avoiding obvious/common terms.

**Instructions**:

1. **Identify Named Entities**: Scan the post content for specific people, products, companies, technologies, platforms, and services that readers might want to learn more about. Important: only link the first appearance of a term.

2. **Avoid Obvious Terms**: Do NOT link common/obvious terms like:
   - Operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux)
   - Generic platforms (GitHub, Twitter, YouTube)
   - Common file formats or protocols
   - Basic technical terms

3. **Use Web Search to Identify Authoritative References** 
   - If you can't find an authoritative reference, but in your opinion the item deserves a link, link to a placeholder URL.

4. **Link Strategy**: 
   - Link the first appearance of a named entity. Do not link subsequent appearances.
   - Link to **informational pages**, not direct tool access
     - Product announcement pages
     - Overview/feature pages
     - Company about pages
     - Documentation pages
     - Avoid login/signup pages

5. **Playwright Testing Process**:
   - Navigate to each potential link URL
   - If you detect a `Cloudflare` interstitial (e.g., "Just a moment...", element id `cf-please-wait`, `[data-translate="checking_browser"]`, or iframe URL containing "challenge"):
     - Wait up to 30s, checking every 1-2s
     - If still present, reload once and wait again up to 15s
     - If still present, mark as "UNRESOLVED (CF gate)" and continue
   - Verify the page loads and contains relevant content
   - Always check links
   - For LinkedIn, make sure the match fits the profile of someone involved in AI
   - Only use links that are accessible

6. **Link Format**: Use standard markdown format: `[Entity Name](URL)`

7. **Content Preservation**:
   - ONLY modify links
   - Do NOT change any other content
   - Ignore linter errors (they aren't accurate for markdown)

**Example Entities to Link**:

- Person names
- AI models (GPT-5, Claude, Sonnet 4, Opus 4.1)
- AI platforms (ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude Artifacts)
- Specific technologies (MCP, Claude Artifacts, ChatGPT Canvas)
- Specialized services (Claude Team)
- Companies that aren't extremely well known (Dagger, MotherDuck, MongoDB)
- Product names that aren't extremely well known

**Example Entities to Avoid**:

- Extremely well known people
- Extremely well known companies (Apple, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft)
- Extremely well known product names (macOS, GitHub, Windows, Linux, iPhone)
- Basic web platforms
- Common file formats
- Generic technical terms

**Output**: Update the markdown file with appropriate links while preserving all other content exactly as-is.
