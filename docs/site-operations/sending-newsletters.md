# Sending Newsletters

Guide for creating and sending newsletters via Beehiiv for cto4.ai.

## Newsletter Format Options

| Format                  | Description                                     | Best For                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Full post**           | Entire blog post in email                       | Maximizing reader value, high engagement |
| **Teaser + link**       | Summary with "Read more" link                   | Driving site traffic, tracking reads     |
| **Digest**              | Multiple recent posts summarized                | High posting frequency, variety          |
| **Original + excerpts** | Personal intro + featured content + quick links | Building relationship, first newsletters |

### Recommended First Newsletter Format

For your first send (especially after subscribers have been waiting):

1. **Personal intro** (2-3 paragraphs) - Who you are, what they'll get, why now
2. **One featured post** - Full text or substantial excerpt with link
3. **Quick links** - 2-3 recent posts they might have missed
4. **Simple CTA** - "Reply and tell me what topics interest you"

This works because it:

- Introduces yourself to subscribers who signed up and forgot
- Delivers immediate value
- Gives options without overwhelming
- Opens dialogue for feedback

## Best Practices

### Timing

| Day           | Time    | Notes                                     |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Tuesday**   | 10am CT | Strong choice - inbox cleared from Monday |
| **Wednesday** | 10am CT | Peak mid-week engagement                  |
| **Thursday**  | 10am CT | Good for thought leadership content       |
| Monday AM     | -       | Avoid: inbox overload from weekend        |
| Friday PM     | -       | Avoid: weekend mindset, low engagement    |

**For B2B/CTO audience:** Tuesday or Wednesday 10am CT tends to perform best.

**Why 10am CT specifically:**

- Beehiiv sends based on _your_ timezone, not each recipient's
- 10am CT = 11am ET (still morning) and 8am PT (early but working)
- Catches most US-based readers during prime work hours

**Recommendation:** Start with Tuesday 10am CT, then check open rate data after 3-4 sends to optimize for your specific audience.

### Subject Lines

- Keep under 50 characters
- Be specific, not clickbait
- Test with A/B if available
- Examples:
  - "This week: Claude's new feature changes everything"
  - "3 AI tools I'm actually using"
  - "The real cost of building with AI"

### Content

- **Lead with value** - Don't bury the good stuff
- **One main idea** per newsletter works best
- **Use whitespace** - Dense text loses readers
- **Mobile preview** - Always check before sending
- **Include a CTA** - What do you want readers to do?

### Engagement

- Ask questions to encourage replies
- Include "share with a friend" ask
- Link to subscribe page for forwarded emails

## RSS-to-Send (Automated Digests)

**Note**: This feature requires Beehiiv Max or Enterprise plan.

If available:

1. Dashboard → **Automations** → **RSS-to-Send**
2. Enter your RSS feed URL: `https://cto4.ai/rss.xml`
3. Configure email format and schedule
4. Enable automation

For free/lower tiers: Create newsletters manually using your blog posts as source content.

## Metrics to Track

| Metric           | Good         | Needs Work |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Open rate        | >40%         | <25%       |
| Click rate       | >5%          | <2%        |
| Unsubscribe rate | <0.5%        | >2%        |
| Reply rate       | Any replies! | -          |

## Troubleshooting

### Low Open Rates

- Sending at wrong time?
- List gone stale? (long gap between sends)
- Check spam folder delivery

### Low Click Rates

- Links buried too deep?
- CTAs unclear?
