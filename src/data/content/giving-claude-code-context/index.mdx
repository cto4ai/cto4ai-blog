I just finished my first deep dive with [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), a Vision proof of concept that extracts handwritten data off clear plastic bags---**filled** plastic bags, that is .... Claude Code and I started Friday, and by Monday we had a robust proof of concept, implemented in Python CLI form, including parallelized LLM calls and detailed documentation. My working time was maybe an hour per day, and the [Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/overview) bill for Claude's model usage was about $80. I'd rate the ROI on that $80 investment extremely high ....

I knew enough to spend time giving Claude plenty of context. I was at the [AI Engineer World's Fair](https://www.ai.engineer/) in June, had seen Anthropic's [Boris Cherny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcherny/) speak. So I had Cherny's context tips, and created a number of markdown files, including `CLAUDE.md` at the project root, along with a well-populated `/docs` folder.

I had noted [Scott Werner](https://worksonmymachine.ai/)'s post [Nobody Knows How To Build With AI Yet](https://worksonmymachine.ai/p/nobody-knows-how-to-build-with-ai) when it first came out a week or two back, and finally got around to reading it this morning. Werner levels us up on how to give Claude Code context, adding some well-thought-out separation and structure:

His full GitHub Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/swerner/b7fd285ec3f2edbcc55ebccdaffc950a). As Werner caveats, though:

> I have no idea what I'll build next week. What process I'll use. What documents I'll create or abandon. Whether any of this will still make sense ... My four-document system isn't a recommendation. It's just one data point in the collective experiment we're all running. A fossil from last week's development process. Already outdated. Already nostalgic.

Things move fast in AI time, but for now, I'll apply Werner's approach on my next Claude Code project.
