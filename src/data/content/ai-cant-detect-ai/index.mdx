OpenAI was one of many who attempted to build an AI tool to detect whether a given document was AI generated.

Announced in a [blog post](https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text) on January 31st, OpenAI quietly pulled the plug a few days ago, not with a new announcement but rather by adding a note on the top of that January post:

> As of July 20, 2023, the AI classifier is no longer available due to its low rate of accuracy. We are working to incorporate feedback and are currently researching more effective provenance techniques for text, and have made a commitment to develop and deploy mechanisms that enable users to understand if audio or visual content is AI-generated.
