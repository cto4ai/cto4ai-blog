# Processing Snips Made Using The Snipd App

The Snipd mobile app allows podcast listeners to "snip" small podcast segments, producing what are called "snips", which are easily shared from the app and its associated web-based sharing platform. Every snip has a link which is served via the web-based sharing platform. When a user creates a snip such as by tapping or triple-clicking an Airpod or headset control, the app uses ML / AI to automatically pick start and end times for the snip (which the user can later adjust if desired). The Snipd platform also often creates "quotes" that contain what ML / AI believes to be a core message from the larger snip.

The Snipd mobile app allows these types of shares:

- Snips: The snip as saved by the Snipd user. These can be shared as:
   - a link to the snip on Snipd's web-based sharing platform
   - an image that visualizes a point or two that the AI summarized from the snip
   - if the podcast has video, a video of the entire snip with captions
- People (e.g. podcast guest), which is shared as a link to the person's page on Snipd's web-based sharing platform
- Quotes: A quote as created by ML / AI on the Snipd platform. These can be shared as:
   - A block of text that includes the text of the quote, an attribution line identifying the speaker, a link to the podcast episode page on Snipd's web-based sharing platform, and some promotional copy
   - An image visualizing the quote and attribution line
- Episodes: link to the podcast episode page on Snipd's web-based sharing platform

## Purpose
Transform Snipd-created 'snips' including pull quotes and links to snips, into clean, consistent markdown format for blog posts.

## Case 1: Shared Snipd Quotes via Copy Text

Snip 

When encountering a Snipd quote in this format:
```
"Quote text here"

― [Person] on [topic description]

Heard on [Podcast/Source]: [Additional context].
https://share.snipd.com/episode/[episode-id]

Snipd - save & remember the best insights you hear in podcasts
```

Transform it to:
```
On [[topic description]](https://share.snipd.com/episode/[episode-id]):

> Quote text here
```

## Specific Rules

1. **Quote formatting**: 
   - Remove the surrounding quotes from the original quote text
   - Convert to markdown blockquote using `>`

2. **Topic line**: 
   - Remove "― [Person] " from the beginning
   - Capitalize "On" at the start
   - Add a colon `:` at the end
   - Hyperlink the topic description to the share.snipd.com URL

3. **Remove lines**:
   - Remove the "Heard on [Podcast/Source]: ..." line completely
   - Remove the "Snipd - save & remember..." promotional line completely

## Example

**Before:**
```
"When the models are extremely capable, the value of a token they generate is extremely high."

```

**After:**
```
On [why online learning and RL amplify model value](https://share.snipd.com/episode/8dd5816c-f788-446e-9a8b-679b141718ce):

> When the models are extremely capable, the value of a token they generate is extremely high.
```

## Notes
- Preserve the exact topic description from the original attribution line
- Maintain the share.snipd.com URL for proper attribution
- Result should be clean and professional without promotional text
