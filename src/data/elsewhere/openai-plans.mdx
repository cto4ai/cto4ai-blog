[OpenAI’s plans according to Sam Altman](https://humanloop.com/blog/openai-plans) Summary of Raza Habib's interview last week with Sam Altman. I have zero confidence that Altman is being transparent in any way here--in fact, my bet would be, assume that reality is the opposite of everything Altman says. E.g., regarding being GPU limited, this is to misdirect the competition and regulators, and not a real or important constraint. And is it just me, or does "OpenAI will avoid competing with their customers — other than with ChatGPT" sound a lot like Google's "Don't be evil" ... yeah, that's the ticket!
