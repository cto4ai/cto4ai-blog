Soon after I announced that I'm [writing every day and why](https://craftycto.com/blog/write-every-day/), I realized, uh oh ... what happens if I miss a day? Well, that day arrived yesterday (June 2) when I had a series of unfortunate events trying to streamline my content publishing by doing Hugo site builds in via Cloudflare Pages rather than locally. I spent too many hours streamlining (or trying to!) and zero hours writing. Well, it's a bit of a cheat, but I'm doing yesterday's writing today, and I justify that because the subject is yesterday 😜. I've reverted to my previous local build workflow for now, and will continue to plug away on the Cloudflare issue while keeping daily writing as a higher priority.
