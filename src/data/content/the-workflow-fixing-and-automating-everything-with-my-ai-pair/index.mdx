I kicked off my [recent post](leveling-up-claude-code-with-boris-chernys-help) about leveling up my Claude Code game as follows:

<Aside>

I think about the kit of electronic tools that support my work as "The Workflow" and man, did I have a lot of ideas for new tools, improvements, and fixes. This 2XL-sized backlog lived in my head until June '25, when I started a "Workflow Tool ToDos" list in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I made progress here and there, with my Obsidian implementation as one example. But movement was more sloth than cheetah.

[Claude Opus 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5) arrived in November, powering up Claude across all its surfaces---Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, and Claude Code. So smart, such encyclopedic knowledge. I used Opus, of course, when I ran into setup issues on tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) and Obsidian. But then it occurred to me: what if I made The Workflow itself a project, with a number of specific subprojects, and got very intentional about applying AI to level up?

This turned into a rich vein of gold that I've been mining ever since, and actually led to my largest AI side projects to date, including [Skillport](skillport). AI granted me the power to radically and continuously improve The Workflow, something I never would have been able to tackle on my own---without my AI pair, there's just too much hard-to-find knowledge needed, too much work involved for each improvement.

</Aside>

Connecting the dots, moving from "I wish I could do something about X" to "I can definitely now do something about X---and Y and Z and A-B-C," is a huge deal. AI is the enabler, but more specifically, the November arrival of Claude Opus 4.5 was, for me, the tipping point. That model crossed some kind of "smart enough" line where there was literally not a workflow challenge it cannot take on.

Below I'll outline how I've paired with Opus to tackle The Workflow.

## The Workflow has a Git Repo

When I realized that I could start collaborating with Claude on The Workflow, one of my first steps was creating `the-workflow`, a Git repository for the uber project, with folders for each individual subproject; sometimes even sub-subprojects. This turned out to be a very important step, because, in following good Claude Code practices for a repo, I created CLAUDE.md with broad information about

## Shut Your Pi-hole

I use Pi-hole running on a Raspberry Pi to block ads on our home network. Sometime in the past month,

## IDE or No IDE? Which IDE?

work through The my Workflow tune-up activities

The revelation that this a huge body of fixing-and-automating that is The Workflow is now entirely within my grasp , until now, I would have been blocked from embarking on due to the sheer size of the work The Claude Code post covered some aspects of The Workflow already, but there are more
