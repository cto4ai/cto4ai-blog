[Mollick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emollick/) has had beta access to Code Interpreter over the past several months and his introduction captures the broader implications of giving an LLM the ability to write Python code. He also points out that its ability to upload and download files (uploads are up to 100MB) is itself transformational, compared with the current, limited copy-and-paste-text approach. Mollick is not a Python developer, but you'll be amazed at what he's able produce with Code Intepreter.
