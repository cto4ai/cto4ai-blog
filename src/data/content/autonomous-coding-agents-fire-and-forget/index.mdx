## Introduction

This [post from Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/) appeared on my radar yesterday morning and it struck a chord with me. AI coding tools are a research sweet spot for me--that is, I try very hard to stay up--and I've been working the new cloud-based tools from OpenAI and Anthropic into my workflows as much as possible. Willison covers

## What to Call These Things?

Willison uses the term "asynchronous coding agents" for the tool category exempified by OpenAI's Codex Cloud and Anthropic’s Claude Code on the web. I didn't like the mouth-feel of that name, and decided to check in with a smart friend of mine, Opus 4.1, who had a solid understanding of the concept and how its being described. Opus and I prefer autonomous to asynchronous, so: "autonomous coding agents."

## Background: The Coding Wars

Anthropic has invested heavily in the AI coding space. Its langauge models surprised many of us by jumping into the coding-model lead in June 2024 with the release of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and marched ahead with follow-on releases including Sonnet 4.5 just over a month ago. I have used Anthropic coding models almost exclusively since 3.5 Sonnet arrived.

Earlier this year, Anthropic jumped deeper into the fray with an actual coding tool, the minimalist coding agent Claude Code whose motto might be "get out of the way and let our great models do their thing." Not long after Claude Code arrived, it supplanted Cursor as my primary AI coding interface.

Where was OpenAI, the biggest AI player all, in all of this? Since 3.5 Sonnet arrived, playing catch-up. I had a lot of respect for OpenAI models generally, for ChatGPT as a product, and for the robustness of their APIs and inference services. But coding belonged to Anthropic.

## Sea Change: Autonomy

OpenAI wasn't, by any measure, standing still. Their release of GPT-5 in August was huge, clearly a substantial step forward, and some were saying it rivaled Claude models for coding. OpenAI followed on up with a coding-tuned model, GPT-5 Codex, in mid-September. OpenAI also released their own minimalist coding agent, Codex CLI. But to me, this all felt like catch-up, like a lot of me-too, we-do-everything action from OpenAI.

What caused me to reconsider was a series of podcasts and YouTubes where someone from OpenAI (including president Greg Brockman) would be talking about other topics, and they'd get onto the subject of using Codex internally to build OpenAI's own products. Internal dogfooding. Here's an example from OpenAI DevDay on October 7th, where Sherwin Wu and Christina Cai of the OpenAI Platform Team https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBGzWS1qd0 get onto the subject of Codex. Clearly, OpenAI's internal teams were using Codex, heavily, in autonomous agent mode; fire-and-forget. I heard stories from team leaders about going into meetings, and being asked "give me a couple minutes here ..." so people could fire off a few Codex Cloud cruise missles that would work away during the meeting, and have results waiting with them when the meeting finished.

Hearing a series of clearly legit, unstaged anecdotes like this repeatedly, my attitude about Codex went from "nah" to "crap, I need to work this in alongside Claude Code ASAP ...." (As you'll see in a minute, the "alongside" part ended up being literally accurate.) As I was suffering with "gotta get Codex set up" anxiety two weeks ago, Anthropic went and launched "Claude Code on the Web" (it's hilarious how bad both OpenAI and Anthropic are with product names). Since I was double deep with Claude Code already, getting its web counterpart set up was low effort, and CCOTW ended up being my first Autonomous Coding Agent experience. https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/claude-code-for-web/

But I didn't really get to my point yet: why are ACAs a big deal?

## Fire-and-forget That Works

In Claude Code the coding agent, you can already fire-and-forget. It's called YOLO mode. You turn off all protections, and let Claude do whatever it choose to, which in a command line or terminal interface, is pretty much anything. Nuke the system drive? Sure thing. Wipe the GitHub repo or more it public? Yep. Shut down your AWS cloud? Uh huh. Claude is a good AI-person, better than most, but YOLO mode is dangerous and developers understand the need to use it carefully. So we mostly do our important work in non-YOLO mode, which is a lot of carefully watching what the agent is doing in real time, with regular requests from the agent "can I take this potentially destructive action please?". I get a lot of code written when I pair with Claude Code, but while doing so I'm close to 100% occupied keeping close tabs on what Claude is up to.

What OpenAI and Anthropic really did with ACAs is give us (fairly) safe YOLO mode by equiping their agents with reasonably secure environments that the agent can go to town in, without risking much. "Go to town" means "run whatever you want, safely" -- usually called sandboxing -- but also "code whatever you want, safely -- you can't break anything." This works because the agent does its work in its own personal code space (technically a Git branch). Nothing there impacts our real code, until we've had a chance to carefully look at it and let it in (to be merged).

## Well-defined Specs, Well-equipped Environments

Willison's piece is pulling me the rest of the way into Autonomous Coding Agents; I did the research and set up my first custom Codex Cloud environment just now. Until now, I've been living with Codex's default setup with no customization and conservative default protections.
