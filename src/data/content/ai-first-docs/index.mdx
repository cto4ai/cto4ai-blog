A progression of insights into the AI world that's emerging:

1. London cabbies must memorize approximately 25,000 streets within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross, along with thousands of landmarks, hotels, theaters, clubs, hospitals, parks, and other points of interest, in a process known as **The Knowledge**. Apply this encyclopedic standard of knowledge, but replace those 25,000 streets, those thousands of landmarks, hotels, theaters, clubs, hospitals, parks, with your organization's essential knowledge. This **Org Knowledge** is within our grasp today using AI, and the payoff of having it will be immense.
1. "Docs-as-code," whereby content in a simple text format such as Markdown[^1] is housed in a decentralized, version-controlled repository (e.g. Git/GitHub), is a superior replacement for whatever closed documentation platform you're currently using and hate (looking at you, Confluence).
1. The documents that make up our Org Knowledge need to be electronic, represented in a format that language models can easily digest, stored in a repository that language models are highly trained to use, and carefully managed.
1. The docs-as-code philosophy applies beautifully to Org Knowledge. Markdown is arguably the content format most naturally understood by a language model. A Git/GitHub repo a very robust content store with powerful revision control and tracking, and one that every LLM can interact with naturally.
1. Docs-as-code by itself doesn't solve Org Knowledge. Business users interacting with Git? Nope. Even Markdown, straightforward as it is for those used to code editing, is likely a bridge too far. The AI may have no problem digesting Markdown in a repo, but how do everyday users get to those documents? How do they edit, cross-link, publish?
1. We're doing this Because AI, right? What if AI were the missing link here? What if our primary interface to the document-atoms of Org Knowledge became the AI?
1. If AI can serve as the primary interface for all of the organization's knowledge workers---they're all using AI all day, every day, right?---the solution for Everyone Else can be simple and minimal.

## Building a Docs-as-code Framework

Once I made it through this sequence of insights, I knew I needed to trying building it.

Sick to death of Yet Another Proprietary Content Platform Soon To Be Enshittified, I'd been thinking about and exploring docs-as-code for a while. I had begun recommending the docs-as-code approach to my fractional CTO clients as a better place to manage their documents (starting with their AI policies) and promised to set them up. I looked for a good open source starting place we could reuse, but everything I found seemed to be married to some niche framework or another that I didn't really want to depend on, as opposed to Just Plain Git / Just Plain Markdown.

Well, what the heck, code is cheap these days, so leveraging Claude Code, I created a decent docs-as-code repo, which I published as a GitHub Template. I had achieved Level 4 above. But even as I was doing the final polishing and publishing, I began to have misgivings. The tragedy that is Level 5 came into view.

## What If ...

My Claude CEO has jumped on AI in a big way and has been radically accelerating dozens of time-consuming tasks using Claude Desktop, leveraging a number of MCPs. Even as my mind was thrashing around trying to get past the item 4 roadblocks, he and I were discussing what he was doing with Desktop and his collection of prompts and "cheatsheets for the AI."

Then it clicked. Why not use AI, namely Claude and specifically Claude Desktop (augmented by MCPs), as the primary interface for managing docs-as-code Markdown documents? All of his core team have Claude seats.

Now we have arrived at the subject of our post: AI First Docs.

- That sure sounds like "docs-as-code" with Markdown, doesn't it?
- If we expand "docs-as-code" to mean "documents as code"
- I thereby expand "docs as code" Markdown is arguable a perfect content format for The Knowledge

I have been feeling that docs-as-code is important in the

Documentation has always been the necessary evil of software development. We've evolved from Word documents to docs-as-code, making documentation more maintainable and version-controlled. But what if we're thinking too small?

The next frontier isn't just better documentation tools—it's AI-first documentation that fundamentally changes how we create, maintain, and consume knowledge about our systems.

## The Limits of Docs-as-Code

Traditional docs-as-code improved documentation by bringing it closer to the code, but it still treats documentation as a static artifact. We write markdown files that describe our systems, but they quickly become stale, incomplete, or overwhelming.

The problems persist:

- Documentation requires manual effort to create and maintain
- It's often written after-the-fact and lacks context
- Finding the right information requires knowing where to look
- Updates lag behind actual code changes

## Enter AI-First Documentation

AI-first documentation flips the paradigm. Instead of documenting what we built, we build systems that can explain themselves dynamically and contextually.

This means:

- **Self-describing systems** that can answer questions about their own architecture
- **Context-aware explanations** that adapt to the user's role and current task
- **Living documentation** that updates automatically as code changes
- **Conversational interfaces** for exploring complex systems

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Imagine asking your codebase: "How does authentication work in this system?" and getting a response that includes relevant code snippets, architecture diagrams, and explanations tailored to whether you're debugging, onboarding, or implementing a new feature.

Or documentation that proactively suggests updates when it detects code changes that might affect existing explanations.

## The Technical Foundation

Building AI-first documentation requires several key components:

1. **Code understanding models** that can parse and explain code semantics
2. **Knowledge graphs** that map relationships between system components
3. **Context engines** that understand user intent and current workspace
4. **Natural language generation** for clear, adaptive explanations

## Beyond Documentation: Intelligent Development Environments

The real opportunity isn't just better docs—it's development environments that understand what you're trying to accomplish and can guide you through complex systems intelligently.

This is the future we're building toward: not just code that works, but code that can teach, explain, and guide us through its own complexity.

_What aspects of AI-first documentation are you most excited about? What challenges do you see in making this vision reality?_

[^1]: Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004, designed to be easy to read and write while being convertible to HTML. It became the foundation for docs-as-code approaches.
