# Permission Pass Email Strategy: Assume Yes vs Assume No

From Jack's Claude https://claude.ai/share/6b49cab5-851b-422b-8788-451a86b6fedd

## The Question

When sending permission pass emails to seed a newsletter list from existing contacts, there are two approaches:

1. **"Assume Yes"** - Email includes "click to unsubscribe" and no action means "you confirm your subscription"
2. **"Assume No"** - Email includes "click to subscribe" and no action means the person stays a non-subscriber

Which approach should be used for launching the CTO4.AI newsletter?

---

## "Assume Yes" (Negative Option)

_"You're on the list unless you unsubscribe"_

### Pros

- **Higher initial subscriber count** - Most won't take action
- **Momentum** - You launch with a real list, not starting from zero
- **Industry norm** for B2B - Many business newsletters use this for existing relationships
- **Easier emotional ask** - "I'm including you" feels warmer than "please sign up"

### Cons

- **Legal risk** - Violates GDPR, CASL, and potentially CAN-SPAM
- **Deliverability damage** - Higher unsubscribe/complaint rates hurt sender reputation
- **Relationship risk** - Can feel presumptuous, especially for dormant contacts
- **Quality concerns** - List includes unengaged people who dilute metrics

---

## "Assume No" (Positive Option)

_"Click here if you'd like to subscribe"_

### Pros

- **Legally bulletproof** - Explicit consent meets all regulations
- **High-quality list** - Only genuinely interested subscribers
- **Better deliverability** - ISPs favor confirmed opt-in lists
- **Stronger relationships** - People who opt in actually want your content
- **Clean metrics** - Real engagement rates, not inflated numbers

### Cons

- **Much smaller initial list** - Expect 5-15% conversion rate
- **Slow start** - Launching with possibly <50 subscribers
- **Extra friction** - Requires action from busy people
- **Feels like starting over** - Despite existing relationships

---

## Recommendation: Modified "Assume No"

### Legal Reality Check

- **GDPR (EU)**: Requires explicit opt-in. Period.
- **CASL (Canada)**: Requires express consent for newsletters
- **CAN-SPAM (US)**: More lenient, but FTC is tightening enforcement

Even with all US-based contacts, you risk:

- Beehiiv account suspension
- Spam complaints damaging deliverability
- Professional reputation damage

### The Smart Middle Path: "Soft Assume No"

Structure your permission pass with clear opt-in but warm messaging:

```
Subject: Quick question about my new AI newsletter

Hi [Name],

I'm launching a focused newsletter about AI for CTOs at CTO4.AI,
separate from my consulting work at Crafty CTO.

Since we've connected professionally, I wanted to invite you first.

[BIG BUTTON: Yes, Add Me to CTO4.AI]

If you're not interested, no action needed - I won't add you.
But I'd love to have you along for the journey.

Best,
Jack

P.S. - This is a one-time invitation. I won't ask again.
```

### Segmented Approach

**Group A: Hot Contacts** (recent clients, active relationships)

- Send personalized emails
- Expect 20-30% opt-in rate
- Follow up individually with key people

**Group B: Warm Contacts** (past clients, met at conferences)

- Send semi-personalized batch
- Expect 10-15% opt-in rate
- No follow-up

**Group C: Cold Contacts** (old database, loose connections)

- Maybe skip entirely
- Or send very soft invitation
- Expect <5% opt-in rate

### Why This Works

1. **Legal protection** - Clear opt-in required
2. **Relationship preserved** - Respectful, not presumptuous
3. **Quality over quantity** - 100 engaged subscribers > 500 ghosts
4. **Room to grow** - Can always do more outreach later

---

## The Hard Truth

**Starting with "Assume Yes"** feels easier but creates technical debt:

- Months spent cleaning the list
- Deliverability issues compound
- Unengaged subscribers are worthless

**Starting with "Assume No"** feels harder but builds a foundation:

- Every subscriber actually wants your content
- Open rates stay high (good for deliverability)
- You can be bolder with content knowing they opted in

---

## Implementation Action Plan

### Week 1

- Send permission pass with "Assume No" to best 100 contacts
- Track open and click rates
- Note any replies or feedback

### Week 2

- Based on response rate, adjust messaging
- Send to next 200 contacts
- Begin preparing public launch

### Week 3

- Launch publicly with earned subscriber base
- Announce on social media
- Add signup forms to website

### Ongoing

- Focus on organic growth from great content
- Leverage existing subscribers for referrals
- Build reputation through consistent value

---

## Key Principle

**Permission is an asset, not an obstacle.**

The people who actively choose to subscribe are the ones who will actually:

- Read your content
- Share with colleagues
- Provide valuable feedback
- Become clients or partners

Those are the subscribers worth having.

## Metrics to Track

- **Permission Pass Open Rate**: Target 40-50%
- **Click-to-Subscribe Rate**: Target 10-15% of recipients
- **Unsubscribe Rate Week 1**: Should be <2% if list quality is good
- **Open Rate First Newsletter**: Should be >40% with confirmed opt-in
- **Complaint Rate**: Must stay below 0.1% for deliverability
