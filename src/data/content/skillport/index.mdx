## Anthropic's Fantastic Fall of Skills-n-Tools

I joke about AI years being like dog years, but I just asked Claude to give me Anthropic's 2025 timeline of important announcements and releases to include in this post. But I decided to drop everything before August 25th, because the stuff that happened earlier **seems like ancient history**.

Over a period of just 15 weeks\*, here's what Anthropic announced and delivered that directly related to the Skills and MCP-tools space:

| Date   | Announcement                                                        | Why Important for Skills & Tools                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| May 22 | Code Execution Tool — Python sandbox (`code-execution-2025-05-22`)  | **Code execution arrives.** Claude can now run Python in a sandboxed environment, not just generate code. Launched with Claude 4 alongside MCP connector, Files API, and prompt caching. Foundation for the Bash + file ops update in August.                                                                 |
| Jun 26 | Desktop Extensions (DXT) — One-click local MCP installation         | **Packaging format for local MCPs.** .dxt bundles MCP servers with dependencies into single installable files. Node.js ships with Claude Desktop, eliminating dependency hell. Open-sourced spec enables ecosystem-wide adoption.                                                                             |
| Jul 14 | Connectors Directory                                                | MCP becomes consumer-visible with one-click tool connections in Claude.ai and Desktop                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Aug 25 | Code Execution update — Bash + file ops (`code_execution_20250825`) | **Foundation for Skills runtime.** Skills need to execute code, not just generate it. Bash support means Skills can run shell scripts, install packages, and manipulate files — the primitives that make document-creation Skills possible.                                                                   |
| Sep 9  | Create and edit files — Skills-powered file creation (preview)      | **Skills' first killer app.** This feature is entirely powered by Skills internally (docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf). Proves the Skills architecture works for end-users, not just developers.                                                                                                                         |
| Sep 29 | Claude Agent SDK                                                    | **Skills infrastructure goes public.** The Agent SDK is the same runtime that powers Claude Code. Now any developer can build agents with the same primitives Anthropic uses internally.                                                                                                                      |
| Oct 16 | **Skills launch** — Public Skills + /v1/skills API                  | **The main event.** Skills become a first-class API primitive. Developers can create, version, and deploy Skills. Enterprise customers can manage Skills organization-wide.                                                                                                                                   |
| Oct 21 | Create and edit files GA — Network/egress controls                  | **Enterprise-ready Skills execution.** Admins can control what Skills can access (package managers only, allowlisted domains, or full internet). Critical for regulated industries.                                                                                                                           |
| Oct 27 | Claude for Excel — Excel add-in (research preview)                  | **Skills meet enterprise workflows.** Excel is where finance actually happens. An Excel Skill that understands workbooks, formulas, and cell references is a template for domain-specific Skills.                                                                                                             |
| Nov 3  | Claude Code Plugin Marketplaces                                     | Decentralized Skill distribution arrives. Anyone can create and host a plugin marketplace — no Anthropic approval needed. This is the distribution model for Skills in Claude Code: curated collections that teams and communities can share via /plugin marketplace add.                                     |
| Nov 4  | **Code execution with MCP** — Engineering blog                      | **The conceptual foundation.** Explains why presenting MCP tools as code APIs (instead of direct tool calls) dramatically reduces token overhead. Explicitly connects to Skills — agents can persist reusable code with SKILL.md files. This paper laid the groundwork for Advanced Tool Use two weeks later. |
| Nov 20 | **Advanced Tool Use** — Tool Search Tool, Programmatic Tool Calling | **Patterns that apply to Skills and MCP.** Skills frequently pair with MCP servers, and these patterns — deferred loading, on-demand discovery, programmatic orchestration — apply directly to that layer. We've already adapted these concepts within Skillport.                                             |
| Nov 20 | MCPB (MCP Bundles) — DXT renamed, moved to MCP project              | **Cross-client portability.** DXT becomes MCPB under the official MCP project. Bundles now work in any MCP-compatible app, not just Claude. Same week as Advanced Tool Use — the distribution format matures alongside the usage patterns.                                                                    |
| Nov 24 | Opus 4.5 — 80.9% SWE-bench, $5/$25 pricing                          | **Better model + lower prices = more Skill usage.** 67% price cut on Opus makes complex, multi-Skill workflows economically viable.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Nov 24 | Claude for Excel — Beta expands to all Max, Team, Enterprise        | **Excel Skill matures.** Adds pivot tables, charts, file uploads. Validates the "Skill as Office add-in" pattern at broader scale.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Nov 25 | MCP Nov spec — Async ops, registry, extensions                      | **MCP becomes Skill-compatible.** Async operations mean long-running Skills don't block. Extensions framework hints at Skill-like modularity in the protocol itself. Registry shows how discovery could work.                                                                                                 |
| Dec 3  | Bun acquisition                                                     | **Anthropic is serious about tooling.** Acquiring a JavaScript runtime signals investment in the execution layer that Skills depend on.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Dec 9  | MCP → Linux Foundation — AAIF with OpenAI, Block, Google, Microsoft | **Skills' transport layer is now neutral.** MCP under Linux Foundation means Skills can flow across any platform that adopts MCP. Anthropic can't be accused of lock-in. Competitors have to adopt or fragment.                                                                                               |
| Dec 18 | **Agent Skills open standard** — Portable Skills, enterprise admin  | **Skills become portable.** Skills built for Claude work in ChatGPT, Cursor, or any adopting platform. This is the "write once, run anywhere" moment for agent capabilities. Partner directory (Atlassian, Notion, Figma) shows ecosystem momentum.                                                           |

## Skills: Domain Expertise Codified

Throughout 2025, I had been working with clients to apply AI in critical business workflows, cobbling together Claude, lots of MCPs, and lots of large, complicated prompts. The results were often fantastic---what used to take days done in a few hours---but the cobbling together part was painful, as were the realities of deploying and running early-generation local MCPs.

When Skills arrived on Sept 9th, and when we realized that the announcement two weeks earlier of the incredible "create and edit files" feature, which enables direct creation and editing of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and pdf files right in Claude, was also powered by Skills -- it became clear that what had been cobbled together could now be elegantly architected. As you can see here, here, here and here, I'm quite enamored of Skills: they are the perfect abstraction for capturing the domain knowledge behind any business workflow. And Skills worked across all Claude surfaces: Claude.ai on the web, Claude Desktop on Mac and Windows, and Claude Code.

MCPs still had plenty of problems. How we might go about creating and sharing Skills across the organization wasn't clear. But Skills themselves clearly nailed the most important problem, and Anthropic more coming in their Fantastic Fall.

## Skill Distribution for Claude Code: Plugin Marketplaces

On November 3rd, Anthropic announced Plugin Marketplaces for Claude Code. Plugins are Anthropic's name for a category of artifacts that Claude Code users might want to create, reuse, and share, including slash commands, hooks, agents, and---you guessed it---Skills. Plugin Marketplaces are public git repositories on GitHub, Gitlab, etc. that contain these artifacts, and that any Claude Code user can attach to and download from. Installing a Skill or other artifact takes just a command or two in Claude Code. The Plugin Marketplace repo design is another elegant piece of work by Anthropic and, among other things, supports versioning.

Very exciting, but doesn't scratch my particular itch: it's only for Claude Code (not the target audience for business workflows), and only supports public repositories, a non-starter for critical business workflows.

## Packaged, Context-friendly, Performance MCPs

Anthropic has been steadily chipping away at MCP's downsides. On the distribution front, June brought one-click-installable Desktop Extensions (local MCPs); July a Connectors directory (Remote MCPs); and November MCP Bundles (MCPB) which replaced Desktop Extensions. On the context consumption side, November was a big month: Anthropic[^1] began promotinga radically more context-efficient and performant models-to-MCP interaction (Programmatic Tool Calling). In a nutshell, instead of the model directly calling all the tools itself, resulting in high context consumption, the model instead **writes code** that does the tool calling and assembles what the model needs. As a result, the model no longer bears the context weight of all the intermediate results, with the added benefit the code runs much faster. Skills can play a key role in orchestrating all of this.

## Ubiquitous, Sandboxed Code Execution

If you're going to get the benefit of Programmatic Tool Calling across all Claude surfaces, you need a place to run those programs that works across all Claude platforms, including the web. Anthropic has kept chipping away at this also. Code execution capabilities for Python scripts arrived in May as part of the Claude 4 model launches. In August, Anthropic added Bash script support and file system operations. : Enabling this mode of operation is what Anthropic calls the Code Execution Tool, which they've gradually been provisioning to all Claude surfaces, granting with the ability to execute code in sandboxed cloud environments. Claude Code got Claude Code on the web; Claude.ai and Desktop got Claude for Excel and Agent Skills that leverage script execution. Code Execution Tool across all Claude surfaces means we are tantalizingly close to Skill-based Programmable Tool Calling, Advanced Tool Use on all Claude surfaces.

This are cleverly designed There are already

Anthropic was on a roll with Skills through November and December. A really exciting development was Plugin Marketplaces for Claude Code. Plugins are a container that encompasses Skills, as well as Claude Code Commands, Hooks, and Agents. And Plugin Marketplaces are a way for Claude Code users to gain access to shared public (Git-based) repositories of those items, Skills first and foremost among them, in my humble opinion at least.

Plugin Marketplaces are just for Claude Code users, though, and currently only support public repos. In my workflow use cases, I need mainly the other Claude surfaces---Claude Desktop and Claude.ai---though I'm a big supporter of Skills in Claude Code also. And public repos are a non-starter, as we can't expose critical business workflows publicly.

## MCP Troubles

And then there are the MCP downsides, which are sizable even for relatively small organizations. Although it's gotten better with Anthropic's 4.5 series of models, first Sonnet and more recently Opus 4.5, MCPs as traditionally written (tons of tools) are model context killers. Also painful was that support for remote MCPs and OAuth authentication lagged the initial wave of local MCPs, and local MCPs only worked with Claude Code and Claude Desktop, not Claude the web.

But Anthropic has been very busy; they introduced "Connectors," which are properly-packaged remote MCPs with (eventually) first class support for OAuth, and these work across all Claude surfaces including Claude.ai on the web. (Claude on Mobile has some limited support also).

Then, in their November-December blitz, Anthropic[^1] began promoting and supporting new approaches that enable far more context-efficient and performant ways for models to use MCPs (Programmable Tool Calling, Advanced Tool Use).
In a nutshell, instead of the model engaging directly with (MCP) tools and doing lots of back and forth, generating high context consumption, the model can instead write code that does the tool calling and then assembles what the model needs without the model bearing the context weight of all the intermediate results. Skills can play a key role in orchestrating all of this.

Enabling this mode of operation is what Anthropic calls the Code Execution Tool, which they've gradually been provisioning to all Claude surfaces, granting with the ability to execute code in sandboxed cloud environments. Claude Code got Claude Code on the web; Claude.ai and Desktop got Claude for Excel and Agent Skills that leverage script execution. Code Execution Tool across all Claude surfaces means we are tantalizingly close to Skill-based Programmable Tool Calling, Advanced Tool Use on all Claude surfaces.

## Ending 2025: Momentum and Gaps

Ending 2025, it is fair to say that Skills backed by (MCP) tools had tremendous momentum, strong support and tooling from Anthropic, other big players jumping on the bandwagon, and rapidly accelerating uptake. The Skill ecosystem was a perfect fit for my workflow automation needs, but I still had some serious itches that needed scratching, happs that needed filling.

- Skill distribution was weak: Claude Code had a solid foundation for a solution with Plugin Marketplaces, but with significant limitation of "public repos only." Claude's non-developer surfaces lacked support for these Marketplaces; distribution of skills involved sharing .skill files over slack or email.
- Skills need tools, with MCPs as the typical provider of tools; but as described above, context overhead, performance, and distribution all inflicted their respective pain.
- Anthropic's November-December releases made the promise of Skills that much more real, with code execution and advanced tool use available in some contexts but but didn't quite are typicllClaude Code aloLocal MCPs even those aren't meeting the enterprise need they didn't meetI was seeking ways to But I had some itches to scr
