I followed the standard LinkedIn advice for years. Emojis! Hashtags! Hook them in the first line!

Then one day I looked at my drafts and thought: why am I writing clickbait? This is embarrassing.

So I looked for someone on LinkedIn whose posts are both successful and good. I landed on Ethan Mollick. No emojis. No hashtags. Just plainspoken, informative writing about things he actually knows.

I use AI for first drafts of social posts condensed from my longer essays. So I built a Claude Skill to generate drafts in Mollick's style. It includes four examples of his posts with notes on what makes them work.

AI is good for more than "talk like a pirate."
