Sam Altman declared a "Code Red" at OpenAI this week.

I have questions.

First: Has anyone on his comms team seen A Few Good Men? In the movie, a Code Red is an illegal hazing order that gets a Marine killed. The Colonel who orders it gets arrested in the final scene. The famous line—"You can't handle the truth"—is what the villain screams right before being dragged away in handcuffs.

Second: What color comes after red? They were previously at Code Orange. Is there a Code Crimson? Code Arterial Spray? Code "Everyone Update Your LinkedIn"?

Third: Has OpenAI ever been at Code Green? Has there ever been a moment when things were fine? Or has this company been cycling through warning colors since inception like a perpetually malfunctioning stoplight?

Fourth: Did anyone notice the timing? Three years ago, almost to the day, ChatGPT launched and Google declared their own Code Red. Now it's OpenAI's turn to cancel Christmas.

The company that started the industry-wide panic is now panicking. December is apparently Code Red season in AI.
