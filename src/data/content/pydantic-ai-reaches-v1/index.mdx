As I wrote recently in [ChatGPT 5 Thinking Is So Damn Smart](/p/chatgpt-5-thinking):

> I spent some time at the [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/) booth at the [AI Engineer World's Fair](https://www.ai.engineer/) in SF this June. Today, I got their announcement that [Pydantic AI v1](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) is out, and decided to write about it.

The point of that post was how superbly GPT-5 Thinking filled in my knowledge gaps around Pydantic AI. As I sat down to write _this_ post, however, I realized that ChatGPT's briefing document should actually **BE** the core of this post. That document was a joint effort---I conceived the need, I asked the questions, I played critic and editor through dozens of iterations---GPT5 Thinking did the research, drafting and rewriting.

I write as a learning exercise, but spending hours or days to improve upon the [cto4ai's Field Guide to Pydantic AI](#cto4ais-field-guide-to-pydantic-ai) below would have impeded rather than furthered my learning.

Ethan Mollick recently shared his experience working with [Claude's new Excel-spreadsheet-editing features](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_claudes-surprise-new-ability-to-work-with-activity-7371375383125889024-3C9Y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAABcNZsBSiPCgo2Gr9o5anU48UXl131Q-_M):

Just as Claude had produced a very solid solution that would have taken Mollick's team of MBA students a week to reproduce, so too had ChatGPT 5 Thinking produced a very solid Field Guide to Pydantic AI. So I'll just post this Guide and move on to the next learning exercise in my very long queue, having learned plenty my the role as its editor.

## cto4ai's Field Guide to Pydantic AI

This Field Guide covers the technical aspects and strategic considerations of Pydantic AI, for CTOs, engineering leaders, and company leadership.
