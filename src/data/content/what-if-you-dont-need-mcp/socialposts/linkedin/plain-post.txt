I've been obsessed with maximizing the model's usable context lately. MCPs are a major offender, sometimes eating up 10K tokens each. I actually rewrote one MCP server to cut it from 80+ tools down to 7, which proportionately reduced token overhead.

But Mario Zechner takes it further: what if you just skip MCPs entirely and use Bash CLI tools instead? Models are already great at working with CLIs.

His example is chef's kiss: replacing the bloated Playwright MCP with four ultra-simple Bash commands. No ceremony, no overhead, just direct tool use.

The irony is that we're building complex abstractions (MCPs) when simpler solutions (CLIs) already work beautifully. Sometimes the best optimization is elimination.
