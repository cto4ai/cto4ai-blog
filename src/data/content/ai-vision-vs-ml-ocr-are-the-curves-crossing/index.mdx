I thought AI Vision had won out over "old style OCR" when I wrote [this piece](chatgpt-4v) back in February 2024. It turns out I was wrong; but maybe not for long.

## Wrong Assumptions

I have a huge knowledge gap, and that is what bit me. I had some significant experience with traditional OCR, many years ago, and it was mostly bad. I then completely skipped the Computer Vision era. I had heard of Computer Vision, but assumed that it was just a rebranding of old, bad, OCR.

My next significant experience with extracting content from images, therefore, came on the abovementioned learning project where I applied OpenAI's GPT-4V dedicated vision model to extract and structure often-handwritten data. That effort was amazingly successful. That led me to decide, back in early 2024, that OCR (rebranded or not) was dead, long live AI Vision.

Wrong.

## Sorry, Guy on Hacker News

That was still my attitude as I kicked off a new AI Vision project earlier this year. The proof of concept phase mostly went well; handwriting recognition worked very well, and the only real extraction problem I had was checkbox detection. I was able to prompt my way to checkbox success, and coming into the production implementation felt quite confident.

Right around this point, I saw a comment on a [Hacker News post announcing the new Qwen3-VL next-gen vision model](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45354408) where the writer was saying he had really bad luck using OpenAI vision models on a particular construction form. He went on to say that Qwen3-VL did a great job on it.

I replied with a kind of classic, "you're holding it wrong" response. Sorry, `richardlblair`, I now know you were holding it just fine.

## My Comeuppance

So we shifted into real implementation on the vision project, and there was a pre-printed form, which customers would print out, then hand-write onto. Its primary data section, though, was a matrix of checkboxes. Roughly 10 rows by 15 columns.

And just as AIs had there period of not being able to do simple math, I learned that some visual elements were beyond current state of the art, general-purpose but vision-enabled AI models' ability to understand.
