## Friday Night

I usually tackle a couple hours of coding on Friday nights, and my current AI vision project was blocked awaiting others' work, so I scanned for something I've been wanting to dive into and landed on [Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills) in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).

## Wrong Skill Context

While I'm deeply familiar with Claude Skills, it's in the context of Claude.ai and Claude Desktop, as opposed to Claude Code. Though I use Claude Code on a daily basis, and have built custom slash commands for CD, I hadn't gotten around to trying Rules yet. Now that I know what I was missing, I wish I had started sooner ...

I'm not a typical developer. I spend as many hours each week writing / publishing on my [Astro](https://astro.build/)-based blog [cto4.ai](cto4.ai) as I do coding. Then again, I'm not a typical writer either: rather than hammering away in Google Docs, or God forbid, MS Word, I'm writing in an IDE ([Cursor](https://cursor.com/)), and my work product is Markdown files.[^1] For me, "writing" also includes a significant percentage of light-tech work: most commonly, building and applying Astro's JSX-like components. You can see two of these Astro component examples below: ChatTranscript (for the Claude Code chat) and MDContent (for the Complete Guide).

[^1]: I'm not the only one who writes this way, see [this](auto-link-with-gpt-5-and-playwright-mcp)

My most complex workflows are writing- rather than coding-related, so as my learning project for Skills in Claude Code, I decided to tackle migrating a couple of my core Astro Cursor Rules[^2] over to Skills.

[^2]: Not the old .cursorrules version, but rather the newer flavor where rules live under .cursor/rules/[rulename].mdc

## Why Migrate?

My AI projects don't need to make sense; they are, just like my writing, primarily about learning. There's nothing major wrong with Cursor Rules, and no burning reason to migrate away from them. Expanding my knowledge of Anthropics' elegant Rules pattern, especially in the domain of Claude Code? Now **that** makes sense. I had a strong suspicion that I was missing something by not using Skills in Claude Code. And there were other reasons as well:

- The most painful aspect of my work with Claude across all platforms is context exhaustion and its consequences: periodic model brain death in Claude Code, and in the case of Claude.ai and Claude Desktop, just plain quitting: "Dude, you gotta start all over again, sorry dude." I know that Skills are optimized to conserve context and reduce the frequency of context exhaustion.
- I find Claude Code (as an agent), to generally be a smarter, better co-worker than Cursor (as an agent), even though I'm typically running on the same underlying models ([Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5) currently). I figured, if I cut over my writing automations to Skills in Claude Code, I'd end up with a better writing companion.
- Cursor's sandboxing functionality has been rolled out in such a way that it is breaking my workflows. I'm sure there's a setting somewhere to restore previous behavior but so far I haven't found it.

## Step 1: Migrating Some Cursor Rules to Claude Skills

My first step was to have a long, and at times stern, conversation with Claude Code, wherein we migrated my first writing-automation Cursor Rule to become a Claude Skill. This Skill had to do with all the scaffolding work needed to create a new Astro blog post, using my unique library of components and approach to permalink slugs, directory structures and request routing. Here's the Skill name and brief description in the main SKILL.md file:

```yaml
name: astro-scaffold
description: Technical scaffolding for cto4.ai Astro blog posts. This skill should
be used when creating new blog posts, setting up post directory structures, adding
technical components (images, galleries, chat transcripts, embedded content), or
configuring post frontmatter and imports.
```

(To be clear, there's a lot more to the Skill than this frontmatter snippet!)

CC needed guidance in several key areas:

- Claude Code's naive initial approach was to jump right in and perform a simple one-to-one conversion of the Cursor Rule into a single-file Skill. This would have been the wrong thing to do, and not leveraged the core benefits of Skills. I had to talk Claude down.
- Because I'm familiar with Skills in Claude.ai, I know that Anthropic has a very nice Skill called [`skill-creator`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents/claude-code/skills) that's really great at writing Skills and applying all their requisite principles. I had to fight Claude a bit to convince it to install that Skill, partly because I wasn't yet aware of how Claude Code located and installed Skills, and so didn't know the right words to use.
- CC's first attempt at a Skill violated many of Anthropic's core tenets of Skills, such as brevity, progressive disclosure, etc. I had to force the agent to re-read `skill-creator` carefully, and then self-critique what it had generated. Give it credit: Claude's self-critique was excellent, as was its redo of `astro-scaffold`.

Here's that conversation[^3]:

I then tackled a second Rule => Skill migration which resulted in:

```yaml
name: chat-transcript
description: Convert AI chat transcripts from various sources (Claude Code, Cursor,
Claude.ai via claude-conversation-extractor, Claude.ai legacy format, ChatGPT) to
TypeScript and embed them in cto4.ai blog posts using the ChatTranscript component.
Use when adding AI conversation transcripts to blog posts or when user has exported
chat sessions to include in content.
```

## Step 2: Getting Well Informed Enough to Write About It

I won't write about something that I don't understand. After the experience of creating a couple of Skills, I realized that I had only scratched the surface and a deep research dive was badly needed.

One of AI's sweet spots is "help me understand X in the context of Y." In my case, X was Claude Skills and Y was Claude Code. Claude Desktop and I had a long, deep conversation about this. My part was asking good questions; Claude's part, giving me answers. I realized that the information Claude and I were gathering was really excellent and worth saving, and together we crafted **_The Compleat Guide to Skills in Claude Code_**.

There is so much more power to Skills in Claude Code than what I had become familiar with in working with Claude.ai and Desktop. For example:

- **Discoverability** through a plugin marketplace ecosystem
- **Shareability** with your team via git or plugin repositories
- **Composability** with Skills working alongside [MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) servers, slash commands, and subagents

Take a look; tons of great information. Note the fullscreen icon top right in the component below which makes deeper reading simpler.
