I think about my kit of electronic tools that support my work as "The Workflow" and man, did I have a lot of ideas for new tools, improvements, and fixes. This 2XL-sized backlog lived in my head until June '25, when I started a "Workflow Tool ToDos" list in Obsidian. I made progress here and there, with my Obsidian implementation as one example. But progress was more sloth than cheetah.

Claude Opus 4.5 arrived in November, powering up Claude across all its surfaces---Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, and Claude Code. So smart, such encyclopedic knowledge. I used Opus, of course, when I ran into setup issues on tools like my Cursor IDE and Obsidian. But then it occurred to me: what if I made The Worflow itself a project, with a number specific subprojects, and got very intentional about applying AI to level up? This turned into a rich vein of gold that I've been mining ever since, and actually led to my largest AI coding projects to date, including [Skillport](skillport). AI granted me the power to radically and continuously improve The Workflow, something I never would have been able to tackle on my own---without my AI pair, there's just too much hard-to-find knowledge needed, too much work involved for each improvement.

But let me focus here on Claude Code.

## Overwhelmed by Opportunities

One of my deepest Workflow desires was to tune up my Claude Code setup, to use it the way that I knew it could be used. I figured I was tapping at best 20% of Claude Code's potential. But picking where to start was overwhelming me.

Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, came to my rescue. He posted a great little tweet thread about how we personally uses Claude Code to write ... Claude Code.
