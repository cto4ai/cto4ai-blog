I love [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/showcase/recent/), use it almost every day to generate the illustrations that are an important component of this blog. In fact, this blog's name change from Crafty's to Crafty's Illustrated **happened entirely because of Midjourney**, which made possible the "Illustrated" part. I happily pay $10/mo for these benefits.

I'd gladly fork out similar money for something like Midjourney but for video. To that end, some months back I signed up on a waitlist (or something) with [Runway](https://runwayml.com/). Today I received an announcement that Runway Gen-2 is available. So I decided to give it a workout and assess the current state of generative AI for video.

## We Need a Posse

In my [last essay](/p/write-every-day) about writing, I touched on [IndieWeb's POSSE principles](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) and that seemed like a great opportunity for an illustration. I used this Midjourney prompt:

> a group of men on horseback, riding at high speed, in pursuit of a cattle thief, cinematic spaghetti western technicolor

and this was the winning image:

<SingleImage src="posse-horseback.webp" alt="Posse Horseback" size="2xl" postDir="runway-not-midjourney-for-video" />

Midjourney actually generated four images for that prompt, and the others were quite good also:

<ImageGallery images={['images/posse-horseback2.webp', 'images/posse-horseback4.webp', 'images/posse-horseback3.webp']} alt="Gallery of 3 images" size="xl" postDir="runway-not-midjourney-for-video" />

From prompt to initial images was maybe 30 seconds, and the final image was web-ready in 5-10 minutes including tweaking and exporting to .webp using Pixelmator Pro.

## Lights, Camera, Action

So, we might as well try Runway Gen-2. Same prompt, shall we? I gave it three tries, and it was a win in the sense that I got this fun little essay as a result. But Midjourney-for-video? Not so much.

### Take 1: What?!

Here we see galloping at high speed ... seated backwards on their horses? And in the background, the horses seem to be stampeding in reverse or something. A pretty amazing clip--though not exactly what we were looking for.

### Take 2: Huh?

Here we have ... a group of men riding while sitting on raised platforms fastened to their horses, kind of a war-elephant setup. Hats do not appear to be western in style, they have a Central Asian mongol-hordes feel. The hat second to left morphs in stages from wizard to Cat-in-the-Hat. And on closer inspection, the horses' anatomy and mechanics are nightmarish.

### Take 3: Look Out!

The first moment here is promising--but then a Reverse Rider, possibly a fugitive from Take 1, blows through the pack like a southbound drunk driver on the northbound Edens Expressway. Chaos ensues.

## Nope ... But Let's Be Fair

We're ready to call this race: Midjourney for video has not yet arrived. But a few things to bear in mind:

* Midjourney generates its share of outtakes, including some true horrors (see examples at the bottom of the page). "That's *such* a beautiful little girl, OH GOD SHE'S GOT 8 FINGERS ON EACH HAND" Or "What a cute little bunny AAAGHHH IT HAS AN EXTRA LEG COMING OUT OF ITS BACK" 
* A group of men on horseback is admittedly a fairly challenging scene. 
* Things move fast in generative AI. It won't be long.

So, nope, not yet. But I predict it won't be long.
