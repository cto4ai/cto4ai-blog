It's been on ongoing topic of conversation in the various CTO and fractional CTO forums I participate in.

> There are so many different things that CTOs do out there. I can't possibly be good at all of them! What should I focus on and how do I present myself to prospective employers or clients?

One fractional CTO explained his focus by using a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) chart, and explaining that his zone was in the middle range of the chart, after "product concept" but before "maintenance mode." Though I don't love the metaphor and don't ever want to have "SDLC" be part of how I present myself to a prospective client CEO (yikes!), the core of this message still resonated with me. As a CTO, what kind of activities are happening with my clients when I'm able to deliver my highest value to them. For me, it comes down to one primary activity: **building**.
