Claude Skills are one of the best things Anthropic shipped in 2025. Finally, an elegant way to codify domain expertise and share it across your organization.

The catch: Claude Code users get Plugin Marketplaces - git-based repos with versioning and simple installs. But if you use Claude web or Claude Desktop, you don't get that elegance.

So I built Skillport over Christmas break. It brings the Plugin Marketplace model to Claude web, Desktop, and Mobile. Same git repos, same versioning, same simple installs.

For Claude Code users, it adds private repos. Plugin Marketplaces require public GitHub repos, which doesn't work for proprietary workflows.

MIT licensed on GitHub. Scratched an itch I've had since working with clients on workflow automation.

Thanks to Simon Willison and Swyx Wang for helping me keep up with developments in the Skills space.
