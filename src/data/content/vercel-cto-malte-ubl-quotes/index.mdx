## Introduction

[Malte Ubl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malteubl/) serves as CTO at [Vercel](https://vercel.com), where he leads technical strategy and engineering for the platform that powers some of the web's most performant sites. Before Vercel, Ubl was a key figure at Google, where he created the [AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)](https://amp.dev/) project.[^1]

[^1]: Can't win 'em all.

Shortly after Vercel's recent [Ship AI](https://vercel.com/ship/ai) event, [Swyx](https://www.swyx.io) from [Latent Space](https://www.latent.space/podcast) had a chance to check in with Ubl, and I curated a few snips below.[^2]

[^2]: Thanks [Snipd app](https://www.snipd.com/).

## Snip: Stay Humble, It's Very Early Yet

One of Vercel's successful AI initiatives is [AI SDK](https://vercel.com/blog/ai-sdk-5), which like many Vercel projects such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), is completely open source.

Swyx asks Ubl what he credits for the project's success (other than its perfect name):

## Snip: Dogfooding

I love this as a founding principle:

## Snip: Pick the Right Problem for Agents

Ubl nails the paradox of agents and AI generally---when they're bad, they're really bad, and when they're good, they're magical:

We simply need to pick the right problems!
