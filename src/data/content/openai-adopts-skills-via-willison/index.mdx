I'm a huge fan of Anthropic's Agent Skills---AKA Claude Skills AKA Skills---as you can see from my recent posts [here](cursor-rules-to-claude-skills) and [here](anthropic-stop-building-agents-start-building-skills). [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) notes that OpenAI has, very quietly, added support for skills in both ChatGPT and [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex). Hurray!

The concept of Skills is so simple and LLM-friendly that really any reasonably smart model should easily be able to use them, after spending a few minutes looking at their structure and reading docs. I was just asking [Antigravity](kevin-hou-antigravity) / [Gemini 3 Pro](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/) yesterday if it could run Skills, and after looking through my `.claude/skills` directory, its response was "no problem" ...

But having first-class support out of the box is significantly better. Maybe OpenAI will even admit and document the capability sometime soon.
