[Apple Vision](https://stratechery.com/2023/apple-vision/) Stratechery's Ben Thompson with an excellent take on Vision Pro. He was able to get a few minutes hands-on with the device yesterday. His take aligns very much with [my own](https://craftycto.com/micro/sloppy-apple-keynote-pt2/). Pre-event, I kept thinking, "put AR/VR aside, this thing could be a really great replacement for external monitors" and Ben goes there and beyond as he looks at likely evolving uses of Vision products over time.

Well written and worth a read.
