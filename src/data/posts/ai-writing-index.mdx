As I dig in to recap what I saw and learned at the [AI Engineer World's Fair 2025 in San Francisco](https://www.ai.engineer/), I was forced to face my failure to write consistently -- a failure that dates back almost exactly a year, to June 12, 2024. Thinking back on it, I see two causes. First, my book of business on the fractional CTO side of things filled up completely, reducing available writing time. Second, the [AI emergence](/p/the-emergence-s1e4), like [Solomon Epstein's ill-fated space yacht in *The Expanse*](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6qx9dj), just kept accelerating. I had "gotta write about that!!" panics daily, until I finally had to just stop rather than driving myself nuts.

I do have to say, though, that during the 16 months from February 2023 to June 2024:

* I was early to AI
* I wrote a lot
* It was pretty decent stuff
* My opinions and predictions regularly proved accurate. (One prediction, that [Apple might get pinched](/p/an-appllama-week#my-take-on-apple-in-llmgpt-land) by the AI emergence, is playing out in front of our eyes right now. Apple had little AI-related to announce at this week's WWDC, and had no visibility whatsoever at [AIEWF2025](https://www.ai.engineer/).)

It's also pretty amazing to see what has happened in the past year. At AIEWF2025, Simon Willison was forced to cut the scope of [his LLM update keynote](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/6/six-months-in-llms/) from "the past year" to "the past six months" to have a prayer of finishing in the allotted 20 minutes.

Anyway, take a look at some of the stuff below and see what you think.

P.S.: In June 2025, [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and LLMs are vastly better at writing Markdown than a year ago.
