🔥 **Andrew Ng: "I know many great leaders still doing things the way they were in 2022"**

The technology is moving so fast that workflows from 2022 simply don't work in 2025.

💡 **The Wake-Up Call**: If you can't use LLMs effectively, you're much less effective than someone who can.

🌐 **The Analogy**: Once upon a time, there was no web search. Today, would you hire anyone who doesn't know how to search the web?

⚡ **The Bottom Line**: For many job roles, we're well past the point where LLM proficiency is optional—it's essential.
