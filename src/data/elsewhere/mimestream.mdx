[Why I Use Mimestream for Gmail](https://tidbits.com/2023/05/24/why-i-use-mimestream-for-gmail/) Based on what I'm reading about Mimestream, I'm reconsidering my attitude that "I need a mail app that works with more than just Gmail," because when I did an inventory and considered importance as a factor, 95% of my important email interactions are from Gmail accounts. I'm thinking I'd use Apple Mail for non-Gmail and Mimestream for Gmail (Mac only for now). I'm currently testing Mimestream on their free trial.
