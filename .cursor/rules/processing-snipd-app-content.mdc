# Processing Snips And Other Content From The Snipd App

## Overview

The Snipd mobile app allows podcast listeners to "snip" small podcast segments, producing what are called "snips", which are easily shared from the app and its associated web-based sharing platform, share.snipd.com. Every snip has a link on share.snipd.com. When a user creates a snip such as by tapping or triple-clicking an Airpod or headset control, the app uses ML / AI to automatically pick start and end times for the snip (which the user can later adjust if desired). 

The Snipd platform also often creates "quotes" that contain what ML / AI believes to be a core message from the larger snip; users can also share quotes from the app's transcript screen.

## Snipd Object Model and How To Process Snipd Objects

The Snipd mobile app supports these shareable object types:

### Snips 

The snip as saved by the Snipd user. Snips can be shared as:

#### Snip Link
A link to the snip on share.snipd.com. Examples of snip links: `https://share.snipd.com/snip/3a87c36a-e18e-4081-bfd6-84f563afab93`

##### How to Process
Convert the snip link to a markdown link, using the window title from the destination page as the linked text.

#### Snip Image
An image that visualizes a point or two that the AI summarized from the snip. Examples of snip image file names: `snip_image_share_1757275196777.png`

##### How to Process
Create a SingleImage component block that references the image file name in the images directory located parallel to the content directory, e.g. at `/src/assets/images/content/[slug]/[snip_image_file_name]`.

#### Snip Video
If the podcast has video, a video of the entire snip with captions. Example snip video file name: `snip_video_snip/3a87c36a-e18e-4081-bfd6-84f563afab93.mp4`

##### How to Process
Create an HTML video element that references the video file name in the videos directory located under the post's slug name in the `/public/videos/content` directory, e.g. at `/public/videos/content/[slug]/[snip_video_file_name]`.

### People
E.g. podcast guest. These are shared as a link to the person's page on share.snipd.com. 

#### Person Link
Examples of person links: `https://share.snipd.com/person/jeff-huber/SVjd1vxGTj600lQmoLcBcA`

##### How to Process
Convert the person link to a markdown link, using the person's name extracted from the window title from the destination page as the linked text.

### Quotes

A quote as created by ML / AI or a user of on the Snipd platform. Quotes can be shared as:

#### Block of Text
A block of text that includes the text of the quote, an attribution line identifying the speaker, a link to the podcast episode page on Snipd's web-based sharing platform, and some promotional copy. Example quote text block (backticks added after copying):

```
"You don't have to give an LLM 10 blue links. You can brute force a lot more. And so using an LLM as a re-ranker and brute forcing from 300 down to 30, I've seen now emerge a lot."

― Jeff Huber on using LLMs for re-ranking

```

Transform it to:

```
On [[topic description]](https://share.snipd.com/episode/[episode-id]):

> Quote text here
```

#### Quote Image

An image visualizing the quote and attribution line. Examples of quote image file names: `snip_quote_snip_quote/8fa58784_da31_41d4_ba9d_f0891d8a9283_1757275854306.png`

##### How to Process
Create a SingleImage component block that references the quote's image file name in the images directory located parallel to the content directory, e.g. at `/src/assets/images/content/[slug]/[quote_image_file_name]`.

### Episodes 
A podcast episode. These are shared as a link to the podcast episode page on share.snipd.com. 

#### Episode Link
Examples of episode links: `https://share.snipd.com/episode/8dd5816c-f788-446e-9a8b-679b141718ce` 

##### How To Process

## Processing Snipd Content Referenced in a Post




Transform Snipd-created 'snips' including pull quotes and links to snips, into clean, consistent markdown format for blog posts.

## Case 1: Shared Snipd Quotes via Copy Text

Snip 

When encountering a Snipd quote in this format:
```
"Quote text here"

― [Person] on [topic description]

Heard on [Podcast/Source]: [Additional context].
https://share.snipd.com/episode/[episode-id]

Snipd - save & remember the best insights you hear in podcasts
```

Transform it to:
```
On [[topic description]](https://share.snipd.com/episode/[episode-id]):

> Quote text here
```

## Specific Rules

1. **Quote formatting**: 
   - Remove the surrounding quotes from the original quote text
   - Convert to markdown blockquote using `>`

2. **Topic line**: 
   - Remove "― [Person] " from the beginning
   - Capitalize "On" at the start
   - Add a colon `:` at the end
   - Hyperlink the topic description to the share.snipd.com URL

3. **Remove lines**:
   - Remove the "Heard on [Podcast/Source]: ..." line completely
   - Remove the "Snipd - save & remember..." promotional line completely

## Example

**Before:**
```
"When the models are extremely capable, the value of a token they generate is extremely high."

```

## Notes
- Preserve the exact topic description from the original attribution line
- Maintain the share.snipd.com URL for proper attribution
- Result should be clean and professional without promotional text
