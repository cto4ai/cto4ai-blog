> What I have heard from little birdies in Cupertino is not that there was a miss on this already .... The anxiety inside Apple is that many people inside do not believe Apple's own AI/ML team can deliver, and that the company — if only for privacy reasons — is only going to use what comes from their own AI/ML team.

-- [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/apple_and_ai)

In my July essay [An Appllama Week in AI](/p/an-appllama-week#my-take-on-apple-in-llmgpt-land), I mentioned that Apple "might get pinched" because they move much slower than the AI space is moving.

In a [recent Power On newsletter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p), Mark Gurman recently quoted "a person with knowledge of the matter" about internal anxiety at Apple regarding the generative AI space:

> There's a lot of anxiety about this and it's considered a pretty big miss internally

Gruber's take, especially given his access to birdie friends, rings true to me. Back in July, I [quoted several comments on Hacker News](/p/an-appllama-week#intersection-apple-llm-chatter-on-hacker-news) that gave the same impression, this one in particular:

> I work in the field and [Apple] just are not hiring the people they need to be hiring.
